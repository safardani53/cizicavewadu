Sadly, Louis, died of his injuries shortly afterwards.</p><p>“Louis’s family are being supported by specially-trained officers. We would ask everyone to respect the family's right to grieve in private during this extremely difficult time.</p><p>“Staffordshire Police are continuing to investigate the circumstances with support from the Health and Safety Executive.”</p><p>Witnesses say he was sledging just moments before the tragedy unfolded when he collided with a skier.</p><p>One mum has told how her stepdaughter and friends were behind the boy when the horror unfolded.</p><p>She claimed the kids were effectively "trapped" on the top of an escalator as witnesses and medics frantically tried saving the boy's life.</p><p>She wrote on Facebook: "Our children were next to do down and saw it all.</p><p>“They tried to leave and were told to go back up. I was asking staff why they were just letting them witness it all, it was horrific.</p><p>“We weren’t even told if it was our child when I was shouting down from the viewing balcony.</p><p>“Eventually after 20 minutes we’d had enough and went in and got everyone out ourselves. Our children were a mess.</p><p>"My stepdaughter and her friends are still crying now (they were next to go down so saw it all) and it was three hours ago.</p><p>“There were toddlers and children witnessing very close up a horrific scene.</p><p>"You don't think these kind of things are that dangerous."</p><p>Another parent wrote: “My friend took his kids to the slope and say the boy was sledging when he somehow collided with a skier about half-way down the slope.</p><p>“It shouldn’t happen because the staff should be monitoring when people can go down to avoid this very thing.</p><p>“It was apparently very busy and full of kids. Police were questioning all the staff who all looked in shock.”</p><p>Specialist police officers are now supporting the boy's family.</p><p>Police confirmed a man was also being treated for injuries following the tragic incident.</p><p>A spokesman said: "The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) have been informed of the incident."</p><p>SnowDome confirmed it will remain shut this weekend and said an investigation had been launched.</p><p>They said: "With our sincere apologies the SnowDome will not be open this weekend. This is due to an accident that is being investigated.</p><p>"It is for this reason that the venue is closed. When it is possible and appropriate to make further comment then we will surely do so.</p><p>"We are truly sorry for the disappointment that this may cause."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Anyone with information can call police on 101 or via social media ref 665 of 24 September.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000682276441.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000682250711.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoNzgZZybnFnpJa6uLvRrZ9mq56kxG6wzqacZpqfrnqstculnJ1lo6GypbPEZpqrmaOdfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftamworth-snow-dome-boy-killed-sledge-crash.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftamworth-snow-dome-boy-killed-sledge-crash.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftamworth-snow-dome-boy-killed-sledge-crash.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftamworth-snow-dome-boy-killed-sledge-crash.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftamworth-snow-dome-boy-killed-sledge-crash.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftamworth-snow-dome-boy-killed-sledge-crash.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./christina-el-moussa.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./christina-el-moussa.html>Christina El Moussa Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jim-bob-duggar-all-the-wild-beliefs-and-shocking-scandals-of-reality-tvs-most-controversial-father.html>All The Wild Beliefs and Shocking Scandals of Reality TVs Most Controversial Father</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jim-bob-duggar-all-the-wild-beliefs-and-shocking-scandals-of-reality-tvs-most-controversial-father.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
