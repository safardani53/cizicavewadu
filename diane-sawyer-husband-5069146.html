The couple <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married</a> in 1988 and were impressively married for nearly three decades. Mike and Diane met two years prior to their wedding while they were both at the airport in Paris, according to&nbsp;US Weekly. At the time, the 77-year-old news personality was the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first female correspondent</a> on&nbsp;60 Minutes, while Mike was a successful film director. “I knew before he spoke, I knew before he was walking across the room,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harper’s Bazaar</a> in 2013 of the time they met. “I knew something was happening, and maybe it’s that beautiful hallmark. Cue the violins? But I knew my life was changing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Mike’s marriage to Diane was sadly cut short after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he “died suddenly”</a>, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NBC News</a>. At the time of his passing, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the director</a> was 83 years old, while Diane became a widow at the age of 69. Some of his most known work includes directing&nbsp;The Graduate&nbsp;(1967), Closer (2004),&nbsp;Working Girl&nbsp;(1988),&nbsp;The Birdcage&nbsp;(1996), and many more. During his life, the late filmmaker went on to become an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EGOT winner</a>, meaning he won an Emmy, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oscar</a> and Tony Award.</p><h2>What Has She Said About Marriage?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Diane-Sawyer-Mike-Nichols-marriage-ss-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The Wellesley College alum is relatively private about her life, despite the fact that she spends <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her career</a> asking famous people’s private questions about theirs. However, Diane has opened up about her marriage to Mike in a few rare interviews over the years. Mike talked about the first time they met as well during a 2012 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “If you want to talk about glamorous,” he said of his wife at the time. “She was hiding in the lounge because she hadn’t done her hair or something. I found her and said, ‘You’re my hero.’ And she said: ‘No, you’re my hero. Do you ever have lunch?’ She wanted to interview me for 60 Minutes. I pretended that I was up for it, and we had about 14 lunches.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>One year after they had a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lavish ceremony</a> at Martha’s Vineyard, Diane gushed about her first husband to the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. “When you wait as long as I did, Mike is a kind of miracle,” she told the outlet. And although Mike had been married to three other women prior, Diane called their marriage an “absolute commitment.”</p><h2>Does She Have Kids?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Diane never welcomed any children of her own in her lifetime, however, she is a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>proud stepmother</a> to Mike’s three kids. The&nbsp;Charlie Wilson’s War director welcomed two children with his third wife,&nbsp;<strong>Annabel Davis-Goff</strong>, which include&nbsp;<strong>Max Nichols</strong>, 49, and&nbsp;<strong>Jenny Nichols</strong>, 46. His first child, <strong>Daisy Nichols</strong>, was born in 1964, and was the child he shared with his second wife,&nbsp;<strong>Margot Callas</strong>. Diane told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Time&nbsp;</a>during a 2011 interview that she did not regret not having kids.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I think of myself as a life filled with children,” the blonde beauty said at the time. “In my life, intersecting in a different way… I have step children whom I adore and I think depend on me some.” She also added that she wished she’d met Mike earlier and that she loves his kids with her “whole life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OimKedXaiuuMXEq2ShraOXrq%2BwjG5nb3FhaYNw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdiane-sawyer-husband-5069146.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdiane-sawyer-husband-5069146.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdiane-sawyer-husband-5069146.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdiane-sawyer-husband-5069146.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdiane-sawyer-husband-5069146.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdiane-sawyer-husband-5069146.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chris-evans-sister-oscars-date-red-carpet-2016.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chris-evans-sister-oscars-date-red-carpet-2016.html>Chris Evans &amp;amp; Sister At Oscars Adorably Brings Big Sis As His Date Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./john-kruks-wife-list.html>Who is John Kruk Dating John Kruk's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./john-kruks-wife-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
