Richard's jersey number at the time was 25.</p><p>The family currently resides in Seattle.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;reports that Ashley has even helped Richard's professional career; in 2019, he said that she encouraged him to push for a $1 million Pro Bowl bonus as part of his deal with the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>Over his decade-long career in football, Richard has played for many different teams but is currently a free agent after playing for the 49ers for the past two years.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was Richard Sherman arrested for burglary domestic violence charges?</h2><p>In a harrowing 911 call on the morning of July 14, 2021, Richard's wife Ashley voiced concern for her husband, telling the dispatcher that Richard drank two bottles of hard alcohol and was threatening to kill himself.

Richard had reportedly gotten physically aggressive with her uncle, who was allegedly at the home at the time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Richard was eventually apprehended with the use of K-9 officers after allegedly struggling with the officers at the scene. He was booked under charges of felony domestic violence residential burglary, resisting arrest, and malicious mischief for damage caused to a door.</p><p>The domestic violence component is “not due to him physically assaulting a significant other," said Redmond police chief Darrell Lowe (per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>), but rather because of the relation to Ashley's parents.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Before he reached his in-laws' home, Richard reportedly crashed his SUV into a concrete barrier as it left a construction zone. One of the workers called 911. The SUV was found abandoned close to the home of what has been identified as Ashley Moss's parents' residence.</p><p>Let's hope that whatever troubles Richard has been having, he gets the help he needs. Richard was reportedly thinking of making a comeback in the NFL in 2021, but that could change based on the penalties the NFL places upon him for the charges.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>If you or someone you know needs help, use SAMHSA’s Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator to find support for mental health and substance use disorders in your area: https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov​, or call 1-800-662-4357 for 24-hour assistance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7aktMCrm2armJq%2Frq3NZq6inpU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frichard-sherman-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frichard-sherman-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frichard-sherman-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frichard-sherman-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frichard-sherman-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frichard-sherman-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./yan-huaili.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./yan-huaili.html>Yan Huaili</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wael-kfoury.html>Wael Kfoury</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wael-kfoury.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
