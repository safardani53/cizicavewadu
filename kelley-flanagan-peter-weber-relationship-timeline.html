"Pilot Pete" started dating Flanagan, who was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eliminated before hometown visits</a>. After becoming Instagram official, it seemed like the two made a safe landing in the middle of a worldwide pandemic; however, Flanagan and Weber split for the first time before New Year's Eve and, after a brief reunion, separated again after Valentine's Day 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2022, however, Weber and Flanagan shocked fans when they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>announced they were back together</a> yet again.

She approached him, and there was a spark — so she signed up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn't really want to do this at first.

"Because on the one-on-one, nothing happened between us but he had this, like, demeanor toward me that was so pissed off and I was looking at him, like, 'What the hell were you told?' because nothing happened here for you to have this attitude. And so right then and there, I knew something was going on behind the scenes, and I was like, 'This is bulls–t.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also told the hosts that she had a moment to talk to Peter while the cameras weren't rolling. She explained, "[I told him], 'They don't let me see you. They locked me up in a closet for three hours last week, and they won't let me see you.' I said, 'You clearly know they push some people forward and they don't push others forward.' … It's just I saw him, like, things were getting in his head that he wasn't able to make his own decision and it just kind of pissed me off."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her declaration wasn't enough to save her from being eliminated from the competition: she was sent home before hometowns.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-march-10-2020-kelley-flanagan-attends-after-the-final-rose-with-peter-weber></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>March 10, 2020: Kelley Flanagan attends After the Final Rose with Peter Weber</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kelley was in the audience for the After the Final Rose finale but not the Women Tell All, which made fans a little suspicious of her relationship status.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the show, Kelley watched as Peter broke off his engagement with Hannah Ann, got back together with Madison and had an awkward confrontation with his mom, Barb.

He even tagged her in a video of himself reading mean comments on another one of his videos.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She started making appearances in his videos (along with Dustin Kendrick). The trio did the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"Flip the Switch" challenge</a>, and a few funny lip-sync videos.

No. Do I love spending time with her? Absolutely," he said. "We're not dating. Could I see that in the future? Yeah, of course. I'd be extremely lucky and very happy if that happened. Of anyone, I'm the last person that needs to rush into any kind of relationship. I just had an engagement that didn't work out. I just was trying to pursue things with another woman that didn't work out. That's why right now, I'm just taking it really, really slow."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He did admit, however, to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kaitlyn Bristowe</a> on her <a title="(opens new window)" href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Off the Vine podcast,</a> that he was "crushing on Kelley."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We have just been enjoying each other's time and company, I love being around her," he said.
