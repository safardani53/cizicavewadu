Here’s what you need to know about Chris’ future after his exit from Bachelor&nbsp;Nation.</p><h2>What Is Chris Harrison Doing Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/why-did-chris-harrison-leave-the-bachelor-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Chris remained very under the radar after he left Bachelor&nbsp;Nation in June 2021. A year and a half later, Chris announced his new podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Most Dramatic Podcast Ever with Chris Harrison</a>, where he spoke about his exit from the franchise for the first time publicly. “I was heartbroken. I was gutted. I was embarrassed. I was mad at myself,” Chris said on the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first episode</a> of his podcast, released in January 2023. “I was disappointed in myself. The last thing in the world I ever wanted to do was be an agent of anything negative — whether it had to do with race or anything.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The former TV host</a> also said he was “sick to my stomach” and lost 20 pounds over the controversy. “I didn’t sleep. I didn’t eat. I was scared to death. It was just one gut-punch after the other, and mentally and physically I deteriorated pretty bad,” he revealed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chris-Harrison-What-Doing-Now-EC-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Chris has welcomed a slew of reality TV stars on his podcast, including&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;Nation’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Clare Crawley</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ben Higgins</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sean Lowe</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Catherine Giudici Lowe</strong></a>. He’s also had <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Real Housewives</a>&nbsp;stars like <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kelly Dodd</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Vicki Gunvalson</strong></a> onto his show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>There’s also been major developments in Chris’ personal life since he left&nbsp;The Bachelor. He <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got engaged</a> to his girlfriend&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lauren Zima</a>&nbsp;</strong>in October 2021.

Chris was previously married to his high school sweetheart,&nbsp;<strong>Gwen Harrison</strong>, and they had <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two kids</a> together.</p><h2>Why Did Chris Harrison Leave ‘The Bachelor’?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Chris left&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;Nation in June 2021 after his racism controversy. It all started during the airing of&nbsp;The Bachelor‘s 25th season (starring&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Matt James</strong></a>) when Chris failed to publicly condemn contestant <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rachael Kirkconnell</strong>‘</a>s&nbsp;past racist actions. Rachael was called out for photos that showed her attending an <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>antebellum-themed party</a> while she was in college in 2018. When Chris was asked about the controversy in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 2021 interview</a> with former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay, he defended Rachael. Chris was met with immediate backlash so he apologized, but the damage had been done.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>In Feb. 2021, Chris confirmed he <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>would be “stepping aside”</a> from the franchise. He <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was replaced</a> by&nbsp;<strong>Emmanuel Acho</strong> as host of&nbsp;After the Final Rose on season 25 of&nbsp;The Bachelor, which aired in March 2021. Chris also did <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>not come back</a> for season 17 of&nbsp;The Bachelorette, which premiered in June 2021. There, he was replaced by <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kaitlyn Bristowe</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a>. In March 2021, Chris <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>apologized for his actions</a> in an interview with Good Morning America‘s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michael Strahan</strong></a>. “I am an imperfect man, I made a mistake and I own that,” Chris said. “I believe that mistake doesn’t reflect who I am or what I stand for. I am committed to progress, not just for myself, also for the franchise.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Chris’ <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>permanent exit from the franchise</a> was announced on June 8, 2021. “I’ve had a truly incredible run as host of&nbsp;The Bachelor franchise and now I’m excited to start a new chapter. I’m so grateful to Bachelor Nation for all of the memories we’ve made together. While my two-decade journey is wrapping up, the friendships I’ve made will last a lifetime,” he said in a statement on Instagram.</p><h2>Will Chris Harrison Ever Return to Bachelor Nation?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Chris-Harrison-What-Doing-Now-EC-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jesse Palmer</strong></a> currently serves as the host of all&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;shows. Jesse is a former professional football payer turned sportscaster and was the leading man on season 5 of The Bachelor. In February 2023, reports surfaced that claimed ABC was looking into having Chris return as the host of the franchise amidst the shows’ dipping ratings. Chris <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>addressed the rumor</a> on the February 20 episode of his podcast, and said he’d “never say never” to returning to his old job.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I think it would almost be crazy not to [consider a change] if you’re running a business, any business at all, and that business sales are down 50 to 60 percent and falling,” Chris said. “Everybody can see the numbers, we know what’s happening, and you think there’s something that could change that and fix that? Of course, you’re going to have that conversation. You would be crazy not to have that conversation.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In March 2023, Rachel Lindsay claimed that Chris’ team started the rumor that he was returning to the franchise. “I mean, he’s got a podcast to promote, it’s something to talk about, you know what I mean? she said on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Watch What Happens Live</a>. “There’s no way,” she added of Chris allegedly being considered to come back. “They went through so much with what was going on with everything and the fallout. There’s no way they would have those conversations.”</p><h2>What Did Chris Harrison Say About Leaving the Show?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Chris opened up about his feelings about the show in a December 2023 episode of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Trading Secrets</a>&nbsp;podcast. “I still look at this as a blessing in my life. It was hard at first, obviously, it wasn’t immediate where I felt great about everything because what I went through was tumultuous. I don’t wish it on anybody,” he said, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>When speaking about the backlash, the former host admitted that it was “horrifying on a lot of levels,” and he said that he was glad that he left when he did. “I knew I had to remove myself from what became a very toxic situation, and I did, and that was a very difficult situation,” he explained. “I’m proud of that decision. I’m proud that I handled it the way I did and I still look at it as a blessing because it changed my life on so many levels.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahmK1lmah6pLTRoqpmoJGnv6q%2FzqdknaeZo7Ruus6wZG5pY2x%2BcoGO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-chris-harrison-doing-now-5137115.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-chris-harrison-doing-now-5137115.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-chris-harrison-doing-now-5137115.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-chris-harrison-doing-now-5137115.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-chris-harrison-doing-now-5137115.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-chris-harrison-doing-now-5137115.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./celebrities-wearing-denim-jumpsuits-pics-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./celebrities-wearing-denim-jumpsuits-pics-photos.html>Celebrities Wearing Denim Jumpsuits Pics Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./steve-o-and-kat-von-d-land-at-lax.html>Steve-O and Kat Von D Land at LAX</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./steve-o-and-kat-von-d-land-at-lax.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
