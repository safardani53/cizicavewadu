<time>29 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>ACTOR Chase Stokes starred in the Netflix teen drama show Outer Banks and is set to star in a feature film, You Got Me.</p><p>The move to the feature <a href=#>film</a> comes after he took a brief hiatus from <a href=#>social media</a> after receiving death threats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/AB-CHASE-COMP.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Chase Stokes?&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=#>Chase Stokes</a>, whose full name is James Alexander Chase Stokes, is an actor best known for his starring role as John B in <a href=#>Outer Banks</a>.</p><p>Stokes started his acting career by landing small roles and appearing in shows including <a href=#>Stranger Things</a>, Daytime Divas, and The First.&nbsp;</p><p>He attended high school in <a href=#>Florida</a> and spent his free time surfing on the eastern shore and visiting his grandparents in <a href=#>Maryland</a> where they would go boating.</p><p>It is something that Stokes said helped him when he joined <a href=#>the cast of Outer Banks</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On Chase Stokes">Read More On Chase Stokes</h2><p>“I’m a water child. I grew up all along the eastern shore, I spent my time surfing” Stokes told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Refinery29</a>.</p><p>“My grandparents lived on the eastern shore in Maryland, and there is a huge boating community there, so I’ve grown up on boats, I’ve grown up driving boats.</p><p>"I didn’t tell any of the creators [of&nbsp;Outer Banks] this when I was cast: When we were in Charleston [where the show filmed], I reached in my wallet and pulled out my boating license."</p><p>"They were like ‘Great, that makes everything a lot easier.’”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Chase Stokes turn down the role in Outer Banks?</h2><p>When Stokes was offered the role in <a href=#>Outer Banks</a>, he initially turned down the offer before ultimately accepting.</p><p>John B became his breakout role, making him a household name and leading him to other acting opportunities.</p><p>"The first time I got the audition it was the most bland email I’ve ever got," Stokes told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barstool Sports' Chicks in the Office</a> in 2020.</p><p>"It was four friends on a treasure hunt, Netflix, and the character’s name was John B. So I was like, 'This is f***ing&nbsp;Goonies. It’s a&nbsp;Goonies&nbsp;reboot.'"</p><p>"I said no, I don’t want to touch a piece of iconic cinema and destroy it. I was like that’s my worst nightmare is doing a bad reboot."</p><p>However, when Stokes was finally sent the script months later, he realized he had made a mistake.</p><p>"I read the pilot and I’m like 'Oh my god, this is not&nbsp;The Goonies.&nbsp;I screwed this up so bad.'"</p><p>At that time, <a href=#>Rudy Pankow</a> was being considered for the role of John B but was ultimately cast as the character's best friend JJ, and Stokes landed the John B role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/NINTCHDBPICT000667626159.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did Chase Stokes receive death threats?</h2><p>Stokes started receiving death threats and negative messages on social media in March 2022 after he posted a photo with his little sister Rylie.</p><p>His followers allegedly mistook his sister for a new <a href=#>relationship</a>. Their responses prompted Stokes to step back from social media.</p><p>"The fact that I can’t post a picture with my baby sister without death threats is just f***ing absurd,” Stokes wrote in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post.</p><p>“Get a grip. Family always comes first and at the end of the day if you don’t know my sister and have the audacity to send me horrific messages then just go ahead and click that unfollow.”</p><p>After stepping away from his social media accounts, Stokes cut his hiatus short and returned with a message to those who had forced him off.</p><p>He returned to Instagram on April 30, 2022, and said in a video on his story, “Look, I’ve had some time to think about things and I’ve come to a realization that the Internet can be a s**tty place, it can.</p><p>"But it also can be an awesome place and I’m very fortunate to have a platform of a lot of incredible people who have decided to follow along on my journey."</p><p>“You know what? I’m not gonna let the s**tty stuff be definitive of taking away those who decided to follow along and brought some joy in my life.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Chase Stokes have a girlfriend?</h2><p>In January 2023, Chase Stokes began dating <a href=#>Kelsea Ballerini</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Social media</a> activity between <a href=#>Chase and Kelsea</a> initially sparked rumors of a relationship between them.</p><p>Back on January 13, 2023, Chase uploaded an Instagram carousel post that featured a picture of him and Kelsea intimately seated together at a <a href=#>football</a> game.</p><p>Chase's <a aria-label="post (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> was captioned: "Lil recap".</p><p>Kelsea commented on his post saying: "Go vols" with an emoji of a monkey covering its eyes.</p><p>A few hours later, Kelsea <a aria-label="posted (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>posted</a> her own Instagram carousel which included one picture that she tagged Chase as the photographer.</p><p>The duo finally confirmed their relationship when Kelsea (and Chase!) appeared on the hit <a href=#>podcast</a> series, <a href=#>Call Her Daddy</a>.</p><p>On November 29, 2023, host <a href=#>Alex Cooper</a> <a aria-label="asked Kelsea (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">asked Kelsea</a>: "You are currently dating Chase Stokes?"</p><p>Kelsea confirmed the rumors, responding to Cooper with: "I am."</p><p>Kelsea also revealed that a few weeks prior to filming the Call Her Daddy episode, her and her beau had gotten <a href=#>matching tattoos</a>.</p><p>The couple, whose birthdays are just four days apart, are both <a href=#>Virgos</a>, and the singer confirmed that they both "have little Virgos."</p><p>She gushed about her relationship, telling Cooper: "[Chase] and I have really allowed ourselves to love that part of ourselves and each other: just the need to communicate well and be loyal.”</p><p>Kelsea also gave fans some more insights into how the couple met, saying she "slid into his DMs" on December 1, 2022.</p><p>After weeks of texting and talking to each other on the phone, the two met on January 7, 2023 – which they both consider their anniversary.</p><p>She reminisced on how the two first met, saying: "He hopped out of his Bronco and he did not say a word to me."</p><p>"He grabbed my face and he kissed me, and he pulled my face away, and he was like, ‘Thank god you’re real.’ And I was like, ‘Oh.’”</p><p>Kelsea was <a href=#>previously married</a> to country star Morgan Evans, but they <a href=#>officially divorced</a> in November 2022.</p><p>Prior to Chase's current relationship with Kelsea, he was in a relationship with actress <a href=#>Madelyn Cline</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Chase and <a href=#>Madelyn</a> met in April 2019 after being cast on Outer Banks.</p><p>They confirmed their relationship in 2020, but reportedly separated in December 2021.</p><p class=postsid
