Did I have a few sherries last night? Have I got this?"</p><p>Gok's supporters rallied around to comment, with one writing: "Gok you've definitely got this."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644401246.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/e59bb103-ceaa-486b-a4b4-cacede6ba57b.jpg><p>Another posted: "You look great, very noticeable how much your body has changed.

You've lost so much weight and look fantastic."</p><p>The TV star, who is well-known for hosting shows including How to Look Good Naked and Gok’s Fashion Fix, said he ballooned to 21 stone when he worked in his family's Chinese restaurant in Leicester.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3c4ea249-db41-41d3-9f08-964ed819b8a4.jpg><p>Speaking on This Morning in 2019, he said: “We loved our food. We had a restaurant, food was epicentre of life.</p><p>“We were fine, it was the everyone else who had a problem with the way we looked.</p><p>“It wasn’t until I was 21 stone and moved to London to go to drama school that I saw people looked very different to me."</p><p>The presenter has spoken out about the bullying he endured during his younger years due to the fact that he was gay, overweight and mixed race.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644401250.jpg><p>He previously opened up about losing 11 stone in just eight months when his eating disorder was at its worst - and later developed anorexia while at university.&nbsp;</p><p>Gok added: “I started dieting, and lost 11 stone in eight months. I had a very severe eating disorder.”</p><p>The stylist has previously opened up about his battles with food during an&nbsp;appearance on Loose Women&nbsp;in May 2017.</p><p>Speaking about his lowest point, Gok said: “I was monstrous…I was 6ft 1” and overweight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7f3bb896-e030-4064-bb5c-ee5d56e4d70c.jpg><p>“My eating disorder started when I went to drama school. I looked around me and everyone was this big and beautiful and I was this big oaf and I remember feeling really…this isn’t right.</p><p>“I started dieting and controlled my food intake. I still have my food diary from that time.</p><p>“I reduced my meals down to two teaspoons of honey every day. I could go to college in the morning and then go to work in the evening. Of course I couldn’t and I was exhausted…but for me it was all about the control.”</p><p>Gok, who previously said he has gained confidence with his new figure, has since developed a healthier relationship with his body.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5cae501e-3cd8-4545-a3ab-b97b38f20e07.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>He added: “I did reinvent myself. But I feel like I'm still that fat kid who would sit in the room and not want to be centre of attention. I'm very shy deep down.</p><p>“I've had wonderful experiences in my life, and I feel like my life has only just started.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Emotional Gok Wan fights back tears on This Morning as he struggles with missing his family on Chinese New Year</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmR%2Fd3yQb2dvZ6SdtrR5zKipp6GenHqou8pmrpqmXayyqrPHrWSlp6OoerPBzaegp59dobykt8Oorqdn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-morning-gok-wan-weight-loss-running-lockdown.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthis-morning-gok-wan-weight-loss-running-lockdown.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthis-morning-gok-wan-weight-loss-running-lockdown.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthis-morning-gok-wan-weight-loss-running-lockdown.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-morning-gok-wan-weight-loss-running-lockdown.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-morning-gok-wan-weight-loss-running-lockdown.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dad-loves-mom-more-than-daughter.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dad-loves-mom-more-than-daughter.html>Dad Tells His Own Daughter He Loves His Wife More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./t-j-mcconnell.html>T.
