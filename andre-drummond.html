They were spotted holding hands together during their first date.</p><p>But what went wrong remains unknown; their relationship took an unexpected twist. McCurdy was featured on the “You Made it Weird” podcast of Pete Holmes and spoke out about her rotten relationship with the basketball player.</p><p>McCurdy’s confrontation of never hearing about the NBA player before was just because the NBA player used to mention her as a lady crush.</p><p>She also stated that going on a date just came out of a spontaneous, irrational decision, as their early conversation were awkward.

She had to say yes even after knowing it was a bad idea. After a few days, she called him and clarified the situation.</p><h3>Accusations & Nude Photos</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, it was not a smooth breakup! The whole separation thing was taken to a nasty level. McCurdy (then 21) hovered around the internet because her nude photos leaked online.&nbsp;</p><p>She was just in her lingerie taking a selfie, most likely private pictures that are only sent to your loved ones.

Some said the photos were leaked to take revenge on Andre. And some said it was all Jennette’s idea to make a headline out of this news for publicity shaping him as a bad guy.</p><p>Andre also took the scene on his Vine account and said, “Sometimes you gotta live and learn by the mistakes you make. You gotta move on and keep pushing.”</p><p>He made a video and said these lines calmly, probably an answer to McCurdy’s statements.</p><h3>Charity</h3><p>Since his rookie year, Drummond has been a global ambassador for Special Olympics.

While he was expected to level up when the team needed him the most, he got inefficient on offense.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Andre-making-comments-on-his-coach.png><p>The Lakers wanted him to play along with Lebron James and <a href=# rel=noopener>Anthony Davis</a> in the frontcourt, but it seemed the idea was a big no-no after this social media post comment.&nbsp;</p><p>A fan called him out on Instagram for his not-so-expected performance, and instead of ignoring or taking it as a criticism to improve, he disclaimed his coach, Frank Vogel.</p><h2>Salary And Net Worth</h2><p>In 2022, Drummond signed a two-year deal worth $6.6 million with the Chicago Bulls.
