<time>26 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Andrew Schulz is a stand-up comedian who&nbsp;knows how to work his magic on the crowd with his confidence, humor, and charm.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But even this confident chap&nbsp;got weak at the knees&nbsp;while proposing to his wife Emma Turner.</p><p>The comedian may be able to deliver his punch lines and perform in front of a live audience smoothly, but&nbsp;when it came to one of the most important moments of his life, he was tongue-tied. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Andrew Schulz&nbsp;Was Nervous When Proposing to Wife</h2><p>Aside from being a comedian, Schulz also hosts podcasts. In one episode of his podcast Flagrant 2,&nbsp;he talked about how he <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">got engaged</a> to his then fiancée. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He shared with other hosts how he proposed to his girlfriend in her favorite restaurant.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The comedian had written the proposal lines&nbsp;on his phone and kept memorizing them as he was very nervous. So much that he was sure he would mess it up.<span>&nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span>He tried to be smooth as possible with his proposal and even got on one knee.</span></p><p><span>But he eventually messed up as his nervousness kicked in. Instead of asking Emma if she would spend the rest of her life with him,&nbsp;he ended up&nbsp;saying, “Will you spend the lest of your rife with me”.&nbsp;</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But as it is said "all is well that ends well," Emma said yes.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Andrew Schulz Married His Wife in 2021</h2><p>Schulz tied the knot with his&nbsp;fiancée, a year after the engagement, in December 2021.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The comic wore a white tuxedo with a matching black tie while his partner wore a white strapless mermaid wedding gown.</p><p>Before the big day, he even bought himself a bronze-green Porsche as a wedding gift. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Later, Schulz <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took to Instagram</a> to announce his wedding with his wife. He posted several pictures and videos from the day. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><img alt="Andrew Schulz and his wife Emma Turner on their wedding day." height=808 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/andrew-schulz-wife.jpg width=650 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Schulz and his wife Emma Turner on their wedding day.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In one particular post that featured his wife, he wrote, "What an absolutely stunning bride."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He even thanked his "incredible collection of friends and family" for attending their wedding and taking out time for them.&nbsp;</p><p>"It meant the world to us," he remarked, adding that he and his bride celebrated "like it was our last."</p><h2>Andrew Schulz&nbsp;Timely Shares Wife's Photos</h2><p>The podcaster from New York hasn’t completely kept his wife away from his social media accounts as she often makes appearances&nbsp;in his posts. Thanks to&nbsp;Schulz's Instagram account, we can see photos from the couple's&nbsp;visits to different countries. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Besides photos from their travel to foreign lands, he also shared one of their Halloween looks where they dressed up as <a href=# rel=follow>Angelina Jolie</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>Billy Bob Thornton</a>.</p><p>In another&nbsp;photo, the stand-up comic can be seen with Emma and a dog model,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">promoting</a> his merch. He jokingly mentioned&nbsp;how bossy his fiance is, who is instructing the dog to sit.</p><p>Look how bossy my fiancé is... not only to me but to an innocent dog model. Someone call PETA...</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Andrew Schulz&nbsp;Wants a Baby in His Family</h2><p>In many instances, Schulz has expressed his desire to be a dad.&nbsp;</p><p>As a comedian, he jokes on his posts, inquiring&nbsp;if someone was ready to be pregnant with his baby.&nbsp;But can we take a comedian's words seriously? Maybe not.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>However, now that he is married,&nbsp;the baby fever he caught (if he did) can be cured!&nbsp;</p><h2>Andrew Schulz’s Wife Is a Certified Pilates Expert</h2><p>The comedian has kept his partner's details away from the public eyes.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Emma’s social media handles are private, so the only way to get some information about her is through other people, like her mother.</p><p>Her mother Kristin talked about her in an interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Yoga Poses Asana</a>.</p><p>She mentioned that Emma was her youngest child and has BASI Pilates certification but wasn’t teaching. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They were featured in a story called ‘A Family Affair’ in Pilates Style, featuring three generations of Pilates practitioners.</p><p>According to her LinkedIn account, Emma&nbsp;is currently busy pursuing&nbsp;her MBA at NYU Stern School of Business.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a7pb7EsGSsm5iqubt5z6umqaejlrlus8iro5%2BqmZq7pXrHraSl</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fandrew-schulz-proposal-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fandrew-schulz-proposal-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fandrew-schulz-proposal-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fandrew-schulz-proposal-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fandrew-schulz-proposal-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fandrew-schulz-proposal-girlfriend-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dentist-killed-cecil-lion-slaughtering-rare-sheep-mongolia.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dentist-killed-cecil-lion-slaughtering-rare-sheep-mongolia.html>Dentist who killed Cecil the lion slammed for slaughtering rare sheep in Mongolia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kindergarten-worksheet.html>Adults Everywhere Are Scratching Their Heads at This Confusing Kindergarten Worksheet</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kindergarten-worksheet.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
