The show encourages people to pursue romantic connections, and to even get engaged before ever laying eyes on the people they are talking to.</p><p>The purpose of the show is to prove that love is genuinely blind — that two people can fall in love with each other based on their personalities rather than their appearances. But while physical features are taken out of the equation (at least for a little while), age still plays a factor.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Is age, as they say, just a number? Or is having a similar age to your spouse an important part of a successful marriage?</p><p>Seven months after viewers first got to know the pod personalities featured on <a href=#>Season 2</a> of the hit Netflix series, the gang got back together for the three-part <a href=#>Love Is Blind: After the Altar</a> special. How old are the Season 2 stars now?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1.

(Fun fact: She also has a twin sister!) On Love Is Blind, she created a romantic connection with Nick in the pods, and the two got married on the Season 2 finale.</p><p>Unfortunately, their connection wasn't meant to be, and Danielle filed for divorce from her spouse of about a year in August of 2022. Danielle will celebrate her 29th birthday in November of 2022.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Nick Thompson (37)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Nick is a 37-year-old VP of product marketing, so there was an eight-and-a-half-year age spread between him and Danielle.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Deepti Vempati (31)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Deepti is a 31-year-old information data analyst.

Iyanna McNeely (28)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Iyanna is a 28-year-old program coordinator, and she was one of the youngest cast members from Love Is Blind Season 2. She created a romantic connection with Jarrette in the pods, but while he was the only one she was interested in, Jarrette also had his sights set on Mallory.</p><p>Jarrette and Iyanna were the second and final couple to get married on Season 2, but they have also since split up.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6.

When Mallory eventually said she wouldn't accept his proposal, he ended up popping the question to Iyanna instead.</p><p>Though Jarrette and Iyanna shared a deep connection, their lifestyles were too different for them to be able to stay together long-term.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Mallory Zapata (33)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Mallory is a 33-year-old communications manager. She connected with both Jarrette and Sal in the pods, but ultimately decided that she felt a stronger draw to Sal. Turning Jarrette down was a highly emotional moment and one that she seemed to question later. Once in the real world, she struggled to feel a physical connection to Sal, though things slowly started to heat up over time.</p><p>However, Sal chose to say "no" to Mallory on their wedding day, and the two never reconciled after filming.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Salvador "Sal" Perez (31)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sal is a 31-year-old executive assistant. While in the pods, he knew pretty early on that Mallory was his No. 1 lady. Because he felt so strongly about her, he figured the right thing to do would be to first write her and song, and then to propose.</p><p>Once Sal and Mallory left the pods, it was clear that they were struggling to get on the same page. They broke up on their wedding day, and Sal is now in a relationship with Jessica "Jessi" Palkovic.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9.

While in the pods, he formed strong bonds with both Natalie and Shaina, but eventually chose to put his focus entirely on Natalie when Shaina didn't seem all that interested.

She created a romantic connection with Shayne in the pods, but she later accepted a proposal from Kyle instead.

She didn't give up when Shayne said he was staying with Natalie, and she even had a conversation with him about it at the group get-together at the beach. As for Kyle, Shaina struggled from the beginning with their opposing views on religion, and eventually she said that it was a dealbreaker.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After filming wrapped, Shaina reconnected with a man she briefly dated before the show, Christos Lardakis.

The two, who had become best friends, explored whether they should take their friendship to the next level on the After the Altar special.</p><p>In the end, Kyle and Deepti decided to exclusively date.
