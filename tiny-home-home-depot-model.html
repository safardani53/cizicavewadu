lifestyle.</p><p><a href=#>Tiny homes</a> are growing in popularity across the country as <a href=#>inflation</a> remains at record levels and homeownership appears out of reach for many.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/NINTCHDBPICT000814826593.jpg><p>The mini-houses typically range from 100 and 400 square feet, making them a bit smaller than the average studio apartment in the United States.</p><p>According to the National Multifamily Housing Council, the average studio takes up 514 square feet.</p><p>While Americans are giving up space, they’re gaining in <a href=#>savings</a>, convenience, and more.</p><p>TikToker <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">@MiniHomeMonster</a> regularly creates videos on how others can save money and live simply by investing in their own tiny home.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON HOME DEPOT">READ MORE ON HOME DEPOT</h2><p>You can find tiny home models from a variety of stores, but <a href=#>The Home Depot</a> has proven especially helpful in getting you started on a mini-home journey.</p><p>One unit, the 12 by 16 Rainbow End, sells for just $4,839.&nbsp;</p><p>MiniHomeMonster showed off the space in a <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">recent video.</a></p><p>The base model costs $3,749, but to get the extra 72-inch door, super-duty floor, vinyl windows, ridge vent, loft, and workbench, you’ll have to pay full price.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>Home Depot describes the space as an outdoor storage barn, but you can easily transition it into an entire home for yourself.</p><p>“You can see it’s a lot of floor space,” MiniHomeMonster said as he walked through the unit. “I really do like it.”</p><p>The barn comes with two windows on the side and a huge loft, which you could easily turn into your bed space.</p><p>The workbench could also be transformed into a kitchen with a little creativity.</p><p>“I really like this one compared to others,” the tiny home influencer said.</p><p>You can customize your tiny home with different paint colors and a living room design layout.</p><p>While most people browsing Home Depot might see the unit as your everyday storage shed, living in the space can save you thousands in rent.</p><p>To make it work, though, you’ll likely have to add in toilet plumbing, air conditioning, and heating.&nbsp;</p><p>While these services have high upfront installation costs, you’ll be saving more later if you opt to stay in your tiny home long-term.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>TINY HOME NATION</strong></h2><p>As tiny homes grow in popularity, several other influencers have shown off how they created their own budget-friendly mini-houses.</p><p>A divorced mom named Jill Kanto purchased a <a href=#>238 square feet tiny house</a> after acquiring a $25,000 loan from her mother.</p><p>It was a leap of faith, but Jill was struggling with finances and knew the tiny home could be her pathway forward.</p><p>"It took me about two weeks to hit the click the submit button because I was so afraid of taking this on and not being able to finish it or just coming out with a terrible end product," she admitted.</p><p>She then used the website Nextdoor to find the plot of land to place her new home on.</p><p>Today, she has no regrets – Jill’s utility bills have been reduced by almost 70 percent and the family’s quality of life has greatly improved.</p><p>Meanwhile, Georgia newlyweds Kensey and Tristan Yaptengco (<a href=#>@Yappyfam7053</a>) ditched their “decent-sized” apartment to move into a <a href=#>500-square-foot property.</a></p><p>The couple spent at least $150,000 on their <a href=#>tiny home</a>, documenting the transformation process in a series of videos.</p><p>In one of their YouTube <a href=#>videos</a>, the couple told their 56,000 subscribers about buying the cheapest tiny home available at The Home Depot.</p><p>The 10x12 shed was on sale in The Home Depot lot for $4,127 or a monthly payment of just $83.</p><p>For many who choose this nontraditional type of living space, tiny homes have been the pathway toward financial freedom.</p><p>"The more that I look at these, the more practical it becomes," Kensey said.</p><h2><strong>SOME RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR HOME</strong></h2><p>If you’re considering making the transition to tiny home life, there are certain things you should consider first.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, make sure your state even allows this under its specific zoning laws.</p><p>Tiny home expert Dan Fitzpatrick, who is the president of the <a href=#>Tiny Home Industry Association</a>, said you’ll need to follow your local state and town’s jurisdiction.</p><p>"Tiny homes by definition are under 400 square feet," Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>"Well, most municipalities require 700 or 1,000 square feet for the minimum size of a house."</p><p>Keep in mind, this varies by state so in some areas including <a href=#>Oregon</a>, tiny homes are hugely popular due to the lack of minimum requirements on size.</p><p>Meanwhile, homes on wheels are often legally considered recreational vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>While they can be parked in specific areas such as camping sites or RV parks, they are not allowed on private land or in a backyard.</p><p>They are also not considered appropriate for full-time living, meaning you could very well be kicked out of your own RV.</p><p>Fitzpatrick said: "There are some places where you build a tiny house and put it in an RV park, and they won't let you live there for more than 90 days or six months at a time.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Another tiny homeowner found a unit for even cheaper, paying <a href=#>just $200 a month.</a></p><p>But with any housing situation, there are still risks involved – one mom was <a href=#>evicted</a> with her family from the tiny home she lived in for 16 years.</p><p class=postsid
