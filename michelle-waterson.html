What is her ethnicity?</h2><p>Michelle Waterson, who has established her name as “Karate Hottie” in the UFC fandom, was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in the United States of America.</p><p>Waterson, whose full name is <strong>Michelle Elleen Waterson,</strong> was born to a Caucasian father and a Thai mother, which makes her biracial. Sadly, the name of her parents and their whereabouts are unknown as of now.</p><p>Likewise, Michelle grew up in Aurora with her brother, Max Waterson. Before she turned to MMA, Waterson was a model who began her career back in 2004.&nbsp;</p><p>As for her education, Michelle went to Aurora Central High School and later attended the University of Denver. Before she could graduate, the young model turned to pursue her career in fighting.</p><h2>Early Fighting Career- MMA</h2><p>Unlike other MMA fighters, Michelle did not have any family members to inspire her. It all started when she first had an interest in gymnastics, but since she could not pay for classes, Michelle then moved to Karate at the age of ten.</p><p><strong>Check out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cris Collinsworth Early life, Family, Wife, Career & Net worth >></a></strong></p><p>Waterson holds a black belt in American Freestyle Karate and is also trained in Wushu, Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, boxing, and wrestling. The American-born rose to fame after competing on the Muay Thai-themed reality show, Fight Girls.</p><p>Later, she also appeared as a fighter in the MTV/MTV2 reality show&nbsp;Bully Beatdown.</p><h2>Professional Mixed Martial Arts Career</h2><p>It is no secret that Michelle is an able fighter who has made her career as a mixed martial artist. But she did not always start as a fighter as many think.</p><p>Before fighting, she used to be a ring girl but only transitioned with <a href=#>Donald Cerrone’</a>s help. Waterson officially made her MMA debut on February 16, 2007, at the Ring of Fire 28: Evolution against <strong>Andrea Miller.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Michelle won her first fight by unanimous decision and hence made her debut without any amateur fights.</p><p>Right after that, she faced Freestyle Cage Fighting champion <strong>Lynn Alvarez</strong> at Ring of Fire Payback on October 3, 2008, but lost by submission in the first round.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/michelle-004-1.jpg><p>Likewise, Michelle made her Strikeforce debut on October 3, 2008, where she faced <strong>Tyra Parker</strong> at Strikeforce: Payback. Waterson swept the victory by rear-naked choke submission in the first round.</p><p>Next, she met <strong>Karina Taylor</strong> at Duke City MMA series one on March 1, 2009, and got the win by armbar submission in the first round. Sadly, many argued that Taylor neer tapped out to the armbar, making her win questionable.</p><p>The following month, she faced former WIBA and IFBA Flyweight Boxing Champion <strong>Elena Reid</strong> at Apache Gold: Extreme Beatdown. But the victory was for Reid as she won the fight by TKO in the second round.</p><p>Moreover, Michelle then faced <strong>Rosary Califano, Masako Yoshida,</strong> and then <strong>Diana Rael</strong>, bagging victory in all of the matches.</p><h2>Michelle Waterson in Invicta Fighting Championship</h2><p>After her debut in the MMA, Waterson slowly made her way to the Invicta Fighting Championships and faced Lacey Schuckman in October 2012. Also, declared as the night’s fight, Michelle defeated Lacey after three back-and-forth rounds.</p><p>Then the young fighter faced <strong>Jessica Penne</strong> for the Invicta FC Atomweight Championship in Invicta FC 5: Penne vs. Waterson on April 5, 2013.</p><p></p><p>Just as in her previous fight, Michelle also swept the victory via armbar submission in the fourth round.</p><p>Likewise, Waterson earned the title of Invicta FC Atomweight Champion. In another main event, she defeated and defended her championship against <strong>Yasuko Tamada</strong>.</p><p>Similarly, Waterson’s next fight was with Brazilian <strong>Herica Tiburcio</strong> in December 2014. Sadly, she lost the battle via guillotine choke submission in the third round.</p><h2>Ultimate Fighting Championship and Rise to Fame</h2><p>Following her success as an MMA fighter and Invicta FC Atomweight Champion, Michelle made her way to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).</p><p>She reportedly signed with the UFC on April 28, 2015, and was expected to compete in the Women’s Strawweight division.</p><p>Finally, Waterson made her much-anticipated debut in July 2015&nbsp;against<strong><a href=#> Angela Magana</a>,</strong> which she won via submission in the third round.</p><p>Soon after her debut in the UFC, Michelle took a year-and-a-half away due to her knee injury. Waterson finally returned to the ring and faced <strong>Paige VanZant</strong> in the main event at UFC on Fox 22.</p><p>Likewise, according to Sherdog, the American fighter won the match via technical submission, a rear-naked choke in the first round. Not to mention, she also won the first Performance of the Night bonus award.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;You might be interested in</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pat Venditte Bio: Age, Career, Net Worth, Wife, MLB, Instagram Wiki >></strong></a></p><p>After her return from the injury, Michelle was eager and filled with anticipation. She fought against many fighters from <strong><a href=#>Rose Namajunas</a>, Cortney Casey, <a href=#>Karolina Kowalkiewicz</a>, <a href=#>Joanna Jedrzejczyk</a>, Angela Hill, <a href=#><span>Felice Herrig, </span></a></strong>and many more with resulted in few losses and wins through a rear-naked choke, split decisions, etc.</p><p>Moreover, her recent fight with Angela Hill was postponed for many weeks due to personal reasons.</p><p>She was scheduled to meet Hill on August 22, 2020, at UFC on ESPN 15, but after the move, it took place three weeks later at UFC Fight Night 177.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/michelle-003.jpg><p>Nonetheless, Michelle won the fight via a split decision and earned the Fight of the Night award. Moreover, she was also awarded BJJ brown belt in the octagon by her coach, <strong>Gracie Barra</strong>‘s Rafael ‘Barate’ Freitas.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=Media_appearances class=mw-headline>Media Appearances</span></h3><p>Furthermore, Michelle has been featured in the Knockouts calendar of 2008.
