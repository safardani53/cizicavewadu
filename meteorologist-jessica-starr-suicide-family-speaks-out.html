She was 35.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Starr's mother Carol Starr and husband Dan Rose both said they believe her death is directly related to the surgery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There was nothing else that we can attribute it to," Carol said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She really knew something was not right within a matter of days," Rose added. "She started to complain of incredibly dry eyes. She had almost no night vision. She had starbursts that she was seeing during the day and at night."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They also said they noticed a change in her demeanor and her appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She lost like, 25-26 lbs," said Carol. "I kept saying, 'Are you eating? Are you okay?' She kept saying, 'I'm not eating and I'm not sleeping, Mom. This is worrying me. I don't think it's going to get better.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Starr is also survived by her two children with Rose, who said his wife "started to withdraw" as she struggled with complications from the procedure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was going to dinner by myself with the kids," he said. "I was taking the kids to the movies by myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though initially reported to have undergone Lasik eye surgery, according to ABC News, Starr actually underwent small incision lenticule extraction, or SMILE. In it, a laser makes a very small opening on the eye to remove a layer of tissue within the cornea to change its shape and correct nearsightedness. It is considered to be less invasive than Lasik.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noreferrer>American Academy of Ophthalmology</a>, studies show the procedure is safe and effective and that complications are very rare. The American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery told ABC News in a statement that "clinical data on SMILE shows sight compromising complications are extremely rare, at less than one percent."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zeiss, the maker of the laser used for SMILE, did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Starr's family said she contacted her surgeon and multiple eye doctors to get their opinions after the surgery. She also reached out to a therapist for help.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Starr chronicled her recovery on her Facebook page, revealing in a Nov. 13 video that she was "struggling a little bit" after taking four weeks off post-surgery. Asking viewers for tips and advice, she reported dimming vision and said she was "trying to stay strong."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In one of her many video diaries, Starr expressed regret for having undergone the procedure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm really mad at myself for doing this," she said. "I don't know why. I was fine in contacts. Glasses weren't that big of a deal. It was fine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Starr's death was announced on-air by her station on Dec. 13.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Last night we were informed of the heartbreaking news that our friend and colleague, meteorologist Jessica Starr took her life," they said. "All of us here at Fox 2 are in deep shock and cannot believe that such a wonderful, bright and intelligent individual will no longer be with us. Her family and friends will be in our thoughts and prayers in the coming days as we all deal with our grief."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><i>If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), text "home" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 or go to suicidepreventionlifeline.org.</i></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfK6x056mq6ecpLSqv9NmoZ6ro56wonnSrZirql2owqqvyJ2cZp6RoratxYysp56Zm6h6sMHTaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeteorologist-jessica-starr-suicide-family-speaks-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeteorologist-jessica-starr-suicide-family-speaks-out.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeteorologist-jessica-starr-suicide-family-speaks-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeteorologist-jessica-starr-suicide-family-speaks-out.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeteorologist-jessica-starr-suicide-family-speaks-out.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeteorologist-jessica-starr-suicide-family-speaks-out.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./celebrities-deaths-2023-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./celebrities-deaths-2023-photos.html>Photos of Stars Who Died Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./major-update-bournemouth-double-tragedy.html>Bournemouth double tragedy: All boat operations are suspended after drowning deaths of two kids</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./major-update-bournemouth-double-tragedy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
