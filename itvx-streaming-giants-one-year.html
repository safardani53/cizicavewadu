It was a really ambitious plan — but we delivered it.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON ITVX">READ MORE ON ITVX</h2><p>The concept of ITVX is a relatively simple one based around four options. Viewers can watch ITV’s shows live, use it as a catch-up service, stream brand new content on the site or dip into the huge back catalogue of films and series.</p><p>The blend has allowed the channel to take on the <a href=#>BBC</a>’s <a href=#>iPlayer</a>, which doesn’t have as much content and also shows a smaller proportion of content debuts.</p><p>Big shows which appeared first on ITVX include <a href=#>Vicky McClure</a>’s <a href=#>Without Sin</a>, <a href=#>Nolly</a>, starring <a href=#>Helena Bonham Carter</a> as actress Noele Gordon, and <a href=#>Archie</a>, featuring Jason Isaacs playing Hollywood legend Cary Grant.</p><p>ITV has also taken the opportunity to delve into new areas of comedy and factual shows, which its big rival was previously seen as dominating.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>Documentary series The Real Crown proved a sensation when it landed this year revealing untold stories about the royals and Alan Carr’s comedy biopic <a href=#>Changing Ends</a> also proved popular. ITVX also taken on the big streaming giants such as <a href=#>Netflix </a>and <a href=#>Prime Video</a> with its stream-only content, some of which has aired on ITV too.</p><p>Rufus said: “People now love being in control of their viewing preferences, and there’s a raft of different services.</p><p>“But people are either watching live or on demand. What we have is the best of both worlds.</p><p>“Also it’s a much more personalised way to deliver content.</p><p>“We’re very proud of the fact we’re a very British service too, even though we do have some US content on there.”</p><p>&nbsp;ITVX services have drawn in millions to watch shows aimed at younger audiences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-south-africas-jesse-kriel-855672370.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/thames-reproduced-editorial-purposes-directly-820457370.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/karla-simone-spence-frannie-sophie-864493217.jpg><p>That is a massive bonus for the advertising department, because ads can be directed at distinct consumers — and the 16-to-24-year-old age group is a particularly sought-after bracket.</p><p>Thankfully ITVX has had incredible viewing figures for Love Island and <a href=#>Big Brother</a>, which both traditionally draw appeal to younger markets.</p><p>The latter even had a live stream from the house airing on ITVX.</p><p>Then there is that unparalleled ITV archive, which has delivered some rather unlikely hits in the form of shows which might have been deemed to have “had their day”.</p><p>Rufus said: “We’ve found a whole new generation of fans for some of our old shows like <a href=#>Broadchurch </a>and <a href=#>Footballers’ Wives</a>, which have come to the surface again.</p><p>“We were surprised by just how well some of our archive content did. The TV landscape we’re in at the minute, people have such a broad range of tastes that there have been surprises all over the place.</p><p>“It’s been fascinating seeing what people have been responding to, and the interesting thing with a streaming service is you can see what any one person is watching at any moment of the day.”</p><p>But the team behind ITVX are not going to rest on their laurels. Over the next 12 months they are going to introduce new initiatives such as a pause ad format, more sponsorship opportunities and regional news.</p><p>The idea is that they will secure the level of viewers as well as the income which delivers the volume and quality of content.</p><p>Rufus said: “We never take our position for granted and we continue to listen to our viewers and advertisers as to what’s next. It is a very competitive market and we never take our viewers for granted.”</p><p>ITVX has 15,000 hours of free content, a vastly scaled-up version of its predecessor, ITV Hub, which only had about 4,000 hours. And it does so much more.</p><p>So there was never any doubt its new incarnation would have a new title.</p><p>But there were a few eyebrows raised when it called itself ITVX, because some thought it might have been an X-rated channel.</p><p>In fact, the majority of people polled before they settled on the name did not have that perception because in the 21st Century it has a very different meaning</p><p>Rufus said: “You’ve got X, which used to be Twitter, and you’ve got Uber X. You know, X is a very powerful letter right now.</p><p>“For us it signified the next chapter. It means the ITV you know and love and the X bit is everything you wouldn’t expect.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“Also X marks the spot — a destination which has everything you could possibly want.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/itvxs-releases-first-look-jason-851817963.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sinead-keenan-dci-jessica-james-797521127.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/32604373-fca7-40a6-ac3b-88a2f4edc6d1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/feb1890c-96a3-4891-9542-1b952088f3bb.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">ITVX’S TOP 20 TV SHOWS</h3></p><p>1 Love Island</p><p>2 I’m A Celebrity...
