Generally offered to new players signing up with an <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">online casino</a>, your reward can be delivered in either bonus funds or free spins. They are used by casinos and other gambling sites in order to attract new customers.&nbsp;</p><p>No deposit casino bonuses are occasionally made available to those already registered. The terms and conditions differ between casinos. However, players must consider <a aria-label=" wagering requirements (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wagering requirements</a>, eligible games, and capped winnings, among other things.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>No deposit promotion types at online casinos</h2><p>Casino players in the UK can take advantage of a variety of bonuses. Each bonus policy is slightly different, with specific terms and conditions affecting how you qualify and spend your money. For most casinos on my list, you can follow the Sun's activation link for exclusive bonuses available to my readers. Make sure to read and be aware of the terms and conditions for no deposit promotions and what gaming products they apply on.</p><p>The following are the most common deals and signup offers to look out for:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Sign-up offers</h3><p>The most common bonuses awarded without a deposit are offered to new casino players as rewards for signing up. Players will receive their reward after signing up for the first time, whether it be a monetary bonus or free spins. It could be that wagering requirements must be overcome before any winnings can be made. Remember to always read the rules and understand the number of times you need to wager the bonus before being able to make a withdrawal A maximum of Â£10 or 100 free spins is available, &nbsp;giving you the chance to take the first steps in your gaming journey without any financial stake.</p><p>You'll often find that free bonus spins are for popular slot games such as Book of Dead, Gonzo's Quest, and Starburst. These slot games not only have a decent return to player percentage and a 100% wagering contribution but may also include some exciting features like a themed bingo or slot game for added fun.</p><p>One of the biggest selling points casino sites have to draw in new customers is welcome bonuses. Depending on the brand these can vary from offering free spins or no deposit offers. Here's a list of casinos where you can get a free welcome bonus no deposit required.</p><li><strong><a aria-label="MrQ (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">MrQ</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Wild West Wins</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Hotstreak Slots</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">21 Casino</a></strong></li><li><strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">PlayGrand</a></strong></li><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Free bonus money</h3><p>Whether for new or existing visitors, free bonus money is occasionally up for grabs. How you claim your bonus money varies. Free bonus money is really another name for a no deposit casino bonus. This is because those looking to qualify simply need to register and verify a new account.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use bonus credits to play table games, and, the same as with any winnings from your spins bonus, you need to complete the wagering requirement before turning it into cashable credit.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Exiting player bonuses</h3><p>It's not just new players that can claim no deposit offers on casino sites - they are one of the most common <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">offers given to existing players</a> along with cashback and <a aria-label="reload bonuses (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reload bonuses</a>. A player simply needs to just keep an eye on the casino's promotions page and opt-in.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cashback bonuses</h3><p><a href=#>Casino cashback offers</a> are increasingly common. Again, both new and existing customers can take advantage. However, cashback offers are generally saved for those already signed up. For example, 10% cashback on net losses made on a Friday. This effectively returns money already lost, which is always welcomed by players.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>No wagering&nbsp;</h3><p>Wagering is another word used to describe betting. As such, a no wager offer is one that does not require any financial investment from players. <a aria-label="No wagering promotions (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No-wagering promotions</a> are commonly associated with new customers. For example, a no-wager bonus worth 50 free spins. You can generally withdraw any winnings made immediately too.&nbsp; These tend to be on the rare side, as only 5% of bonuses requiring no initial deposit have no wagering requirement, either. So if you see one snap it up!</p><p>Most often, you'll see a deposit match bonus promotion that has low&nbsp;wagering requirements, while no deposit usually means higher wagers as well, to prevent abuse.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Free play bonuses</h3><p>Free play prizes are given to players to place bets on casino games like <a aria-label="roulette (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">roulette</a> without putting their own money at risk. There are different circumstances in which free play is available, either as a reward for playing or as part of a depositless offer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to claim a no-deposit casino bonus</h2><p>Part of the appeal of getting a bonus without depositing money first is the ease at which they can be claimed. The following is a step-by-step guide for players in the UK to follow:</p><li>Enter the casino site.</li><li>Sign up by entering your personal details. You may also need to create a username and password at this point.&nbsp;</li><li>Opt-in or enter the relevant promo code before completing the registration process.</li><li>Read and accept the casinoâ€™s terms and conditions.</li><li>Confirm your new account and verify via the link found inside your welcome email.</li><li>Within 48 hours, your free spins or cash will be automatically added to your account balance.&nbsp;</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Sun-How-to-claim-no-dep-bonus-1.jpg><p>Note: Players must meet the wagering requirements before they can withdraw any winnings from the bonus.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why you should claim a no deposit offer at a casino</h2><p>Firstly, these bonuses allow players to get their hands on bonus funds or extra spins without parting with any of their hard-earned cash. This is hugely appealing in itself. Meanwhile, those qualifying can use their bonus to test the waters after signing up with a casino.&nbsp;</p><p>You may play <a aria-label="casino games (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">casino games</a> that you would otherwise avoid. Almost 80% of no-deposit casino bonuses are offered as free spins that can only be used on specific <a aria-label="slot machines (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slot machines</a>. These offers also represent a good opportunity to make a profit. Of course, this will be impacted by the wagering requirements and other terms and conditions. While it's unlikely to attract high rollers, such an offer will certainly stand out for beginners.</p><p>Depending on your gaming preferences and skill, a bonus like this could really bring value to a new player and help them develop good strategies when enjoying their favourite pastime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thesun-claim-casino-bonuses-with-no-wagering.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best mobile no deposit casino in the UK?</h2><p>I chose <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">MrQ</a></strong> as the best <a aria-label="mobile casino (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mobile casino</a> with a no deposit bonus for UK players. This is due to their easy-to-use, responsive website, lightning-fast payouts, and huge casino game selection.</p><p>However, all of the recommended casinos in my top list are accessible on both desktop and mobile. This is due to the increasing proportion of bets that are now placed on smartphones and tablets. Whether you access your chosen casino through your mobile browser or a dedicated app, all promotions remain available. This is also the case with the vast majority of casino games and additional features.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Payment methods for no deposit online casinos</h2><p>Of course, this type of bonus does not require financial investment from players. However, in order to play games in the future and withdraw winnings made, you will need to select a payment method.</p><p>For those in the UK, debit cards, e-wallets and other options are available. However, Skrill and Neteller payments are often excluded from any other bonuses, so that might be an issue for you further down the road. Also, be sure to consider the speed and security of payments, along with any potential fees.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>FAQ about bonuses with no deposit required</h2><p>Here, I'll answer the most important questions UK players have about this bonus type at online casinos.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Can I win real money with no deposit offers?</h3><p>It is a real possibility, yes. While there are no guarantees, many in the UK have already profited from bonuses they didn't need to put down money for. Even though the bonus is likely to be relatively small, when the terms and conditions are fair, you stand a good chance of walking away with winnings.&nbsp;</p><p>I've examined each casino platform and several game titles to find the best option for you, but I absolutely encourage you to do your own research and read every review you can so you can find the best payout casinos.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Where can I find the best online casino bonus codes?</h3><p>Just like with any other bonus, it could be that you are required to enter an activation code to claim those you don't need to deposit for. While this is rare for online casinos in the UK, it is not unheard of. So, be sure to check beforehand whether a promo code is active. I have listed the best offers requiring no initial deposit on this page, including their key terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"><span>Sign up at William Hill - no bonus code required</span>!</a></strong></p><p>Bear in mind that any deposit bonus casino usually has wagering requirements for their bonuses, but certain places have no wagering offerings. That means you can enjoy the no deposit opportunities without worrying about whether you'll get to withdraw your winnings.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Why should you be wary of bonuses without bonus requirements?</h3><p>Like any gambling promotion, casino bonuses with no deposits also come with limitations. The first disadvantage is that the bonus amount is likely to be relatively small. Players should only expect to claim up to Â£10 or 100 free spins. Meanwhile, to level the playing field, casinos may well introduce wagering requirements. These can be as high as 50x, which makes profiting less realistic.</p><p>Finally, it is likely that your bonus will only be available to use on selected games. If you like playing blackjack, some other table game or playing with live dealers, chances are your bonus won't be eligible for those. Most casinos focus on slot games for no deposit bonuses as the majority of their customer base like free wheel spins bonuses and promos.</p><p>Further limitations may include max win amounts and games with higher house edge among already mentioned restrictions.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Are no deposit casino offers safe?</h3><p>Yes. My top-ranked no-deposit online casinos are all licensed by the UK Gambling Commission. While you need to register a casino account in order to qualify, your personal details are kept safe thanks to tools including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption and firewalls.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Which casinos offer the biggest bonuses without depositing?</h3><p>The best way to find the most generous no deposit bonuses is to shop around and compare online casinos. Start by researching casinos, looking for reviews and ratings from other player. Once you have identified a few operators that offer rewards even without putting down money first, compare the terms and conditions of each bonus.</p><ul><li>The best bonuses are offered by online casinos as a way to attract new players</li><li>No deposit casino bonuses can be used to play most casino games like <a href=# aria-label="poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">poker</a>, roulette, and slots</li><li>The amount of the bonus varies from casino to casino, but typically ranges from Â£10 to Â£50</li></ul><p>Sometimes you'll need a code to access the bonus, but a lot of casinos also offer these promotions upon sign up. You can find more information about the wagering requirements, withdrawals, and restrictions on the terms and conditions page. You can also ask customer support for help, and they'll be able to explain everything about how bonus cash or spins work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Final thoughts on no deposit casino bonuses</h2><p>It is clear to see just why these types of bonuses are so popular. While being available on sportsbooks occasionally, it is online casinos that this type of offer is most commonly associated with. While the reward is small compared to some other bonuses, the lack of risk involved continues to appeal to players. So, be sure to check out my list of the best casinos, all of which are legal and safe for those in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">About the author</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/James-Fuller-2.jpeg><p class=article__content--intro>James Fuller</p><p>James is an experienced copywriter with over a decadeâ€™s worth of experience in the casino industry.
