Haynes resumed modeling in 2008, appearing in ads such as Verizon as well as various magazine editorials such as Teen Vogue and Arena. In 2011, Haynes walked the red carpet.</p><p>He appeared uncredited in the 2007 movie Transformers. He was also seen in CSI: Miami and The Hills. In addition to cameo appearances, Haynes appeared in My Chemical Romance’s music video for “I Don’t Love You,” directed by Marc Webb, in April 2007.

After years of public conjecture about his “hidden homosexual background,” an off-the-cuff reaction he made on Tumblr about a comment on images published in gay lifestyle magazine XY a decade ago was interpreted as evidence of his coming out by numerous media sources in January 2016. Haynes sought therapy for his anxieties over the following three months because he was not yet ready to talk freely about his sexual orientation. In May 2016, he came out as homosexual in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. Haynes said that he kept his sexuality hidden because he was persuaded by experts in the entertainment world that being upfront about it would harm his career.</p><p>On March 11, 2017, Haynes and renowned florist Jeff Leatham got engaged. On October 27, 2017, they married. Haynes filed for divorce from Leatham in May 2018, but the couple reunited before their first wedding anniversary. They did, however, finalize a divorce settlement in August 2019.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaqKSkpLtutMCypZ6rXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcolton-haynes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcolton-haynes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcolton-haynes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcolton-haynes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcolton-haynes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcolton-haynes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kathy-wagner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kathy-wagner.html>Fame | Kathy Wagner net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./marbella-police-hunt-gangsters-shot-man-chelsea-smile-drugs-deal.html>Brit tortured and given Chelsea smile in Marbella is notorious gangster Craig Moran, convicted over</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./marbella-police-hunt-gangsters-shot-man-chelsea-smile-drugs-deal.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
