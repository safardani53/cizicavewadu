We’ll all go on the boat,” said Ramona Singer as though she knew there was a storm brewing. “We’ll resolve this, it’s a beautiful boat.”</p><p>“It’s going to be nice,” said Tinsley Mortimer who less than impressed that everyone was fighting on the trip she planned.&nbsp;</p><p>The ladies managed to patch things up while on the trip and had a genuinely good time … until they were told they needed to get back on the boat and well away from the island.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason was that the sea water was getting difficult to judge, and the ladies did not want to be stranded on an island with horrible weather.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/sonja-morgan-image-681x1024.jpg><p>There was no real sense of urgency until Luann was told by a producer to get on the boat without her phone because they were at risk just looking for it,&nbsp;</p><p>“The coast guard [called] and said it was time to go,” said de Lesseps. “Apparently the sea picks up at this bewitching hour of 3 p.m., so suddenly, it’s like, ‘Let’s get on the boat.’ ”</p><p>“We have to leave now. Are you kidding me? No way,” Singer said. “We want to stay here all day and all night. The water is not any more rough than before. Hello, we’re not in a little rowboat.”</p><p>While the ladies seemed to think the producers and coast guard were taking too much precautions, they quickly learned that it was a life or death situation.&nbsp;</p><p>The boat started jumping up and down, taking on water, and there was even a burning smell. At one point, it made me feel like I was watching the found-footage final moments of The Real Housewives of New York City.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/11/tinsley-mortimer-attends-2016-whitney-party.jpg><p>“I peed my swimsuit,” said Morgan. “I’ve been on many boats in my life. … This is like being on a airplane with one propeller.”</p><p>Carole struggled on the outside decking. She was seasick and Bethenny was trying to comfort her, despite the two of them flying all over the place.&nbsp;</p><p>“This is crazy. This is really scary. I’m losing my mind,” Frankel said as a siren started going off. “Why is there a siren? I’m freaking out. This isn’t funny. Oh my god, get on the floor!”</p><p>The ladies started yelling about there only being one life vest on the boat, and before we knew it, the cameras stopped rolling because the crew had to get themselves to safety.&nbsp;</p><p>"The boat was trying to reel in [the anchor] and that was causing the smell,” de Lesseps said in a confessional.</p><p>“So we’ve got the captain, who runs out of the cabin with two swords, a la Pirates of the Caribbean, and runs to the top of the boat and he cuts off the anchor.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Had it been on the chain, the boat would have capsized, and I wouldn’t have been here to tell the story,” said Singer. “We would have all been killed.”</p><p>“We all thought we were going to die at sea,” de Lesseps noted. “It was so bad, even the cameras had to go down because they were holding on for dear life. I’m just holding myself on the ground, praying that the boat’s not going to capsize.”</p><p>Added Radziwill: “I put myself in some of the most dangerous places in the world [but] being in Afghanistan during the war and the Middle East during that war was nothing compared to what happened on that boat."</p><p>"By the time we got back to the house, all of us just needed to decompress, and we were suffering a little bit from post dramatic disorder. Because even though no one got hurt, all of us were just like, ‘What the f— just happened.’ ”</p><p>As for Tinsley, she was in high spirits on the high seas.&nbsp;</p><p>“The boat ride was super dramatic for everybody but me,” she shared.</p><p>“I never feared for my life. But I can’t take away how they felt.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The positive from all of the drama was that it brought the women closer together.&nbsp;</p><p>“Last night just reminds us why we love each other so much,” Morgan said. “We’re out of the boat, and now we’re swimming in s—. And by the way, no offense to Colombia because this could happen in any country. But not like this. Never before like this.”</p><p>Okay then.&nbsp;</p><p>What are your thoughts on the boat trip?</p><p>Hit the comments below.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Real Housewives of New York continues Wednesdays on Bravo.</strong></p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>14 Shadiest Real Housewives Hook-Ups of All-Time</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WFcMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmpZ6vXa68s7eMrJyaq5%2BjenJ8jJ6noqufmbJufZZmqZ6bkaV6tLTIqWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-new-york-season-10-episode-17-recap-ship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-new-york-season-10-episode-17-recap-ship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-new-york-season-10-episode-17-recap-ship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-new-york-season-10-episode-17-recap-ship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-new-york-season-10-episode-17-recap-ship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-new-york-season-10-episode-17-recap-ship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rome-flynn-ethnicity-fantasy-football-actor-nationality-religion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rome-flynn-ethnicity-fantasy-football-actor-nationality-religion.html>What Is Rome Flynn Ethnicity?
