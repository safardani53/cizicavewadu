His parents are Matt Centrowitz and Beverly Bannister Centrowitz.</p><p>The athlete’s father is also a renowned runner and two-time Olympian. Matt competed in the 1500m race at the 1976 Summer Olympics.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, he was also selected to participate in the 1980 Summer Olympics but did not compete due to the <a href=# rel=noopener>1980 Summer Olympics boycott</a>.</p><p>Besides that, Matt Sr. is a long-distance runner who has won four gold medals at the USA Outdoor Championships in the 5000m race. Likewise, he also won a gold medal at the 1979 Pan American Games held in San Juan, Puerto Rico.&nbsp;</p><p>After his career as an athlete, he became a track coach and worked at St. John’s University and American University.

He dated Shelby Houlihan, who is also a middle-distance runner.&nbsp;</p><p>She was recently banned from competing after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug (PEDs), Nandrolone. However, she denied ever using the androgen and anabolic steroids and said that eating pork might have resulted in the positive test.</p><p>Nevertheless, she has appealed the ban, but it prevented her from participating in Olympic trials. Shelby said,</p><p>“I feel completely devastated, lost, broken, angry, confused, and betrayed by the very sport that I’ve loved and poured myself into just to see how good I was.”</p><p>Moreover, she added,&nbsp;</p><p>“I want to be very clear. I have never taken any performance-enhancing substances. And that includes that of which I am being accused.”</p><p>Furthermore, Houlihan is a one-time Olympian who competed in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. However, she failed to win any medals by finishing in 11th place but was the highest-placing American in that category.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides that, she has won a gold medal at the 8th NACAC Under-23 Championships in Athletics and a silver at the 2018 IAAF Continental Cup.</p><h3>Defending Shelby</h3><p>Although Houlihan and Centrowitz are not together, he supported and defended his ex-girlfriend when asked about her positive result. He claimed that he knew her and believed that she did not take any PEDs.&nbsp;</p><p>The Olympic gold medalist even confirmed her pork story and said they often visited a food truck where they ate carne asada burritos regularly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Shelby-Houlihan-And-Matthew-Centrowitz-Jr.-Gaming.jpg><p>Moreover, Matthew shared that he and a teammate’s test showed contaminated meat after eating the burrito the night before. Likewise, he added that while you know some people very well, you might not always know how they are on their own.&nbsp;</p><p>But the three-time Olympian claimed that he lived with Shelby and had knowledge of everything she was eating and doing. So, the runner knew that she had no fishy business going on.</p><p>He said, “But with Shelby, I was there 24/7. I know what she was putting in her body. I know the vitamins that she was taking.”</p><h3>Dating</h3><p>Since Shelby, Centrowitz has not been romantically linked with anyone else. Instead, he is focusing solely on winning at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he is very private when it comes to his personal life. So, the Olympian might be secretly dating someone without our knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>He rarely puts his personal life in the spotlight. Besides that, Matthew has given his undivided attention to running and training and hence does not have much time for his dating life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Matthew Centrowitz Jr. | Net Worth And Salary</h2><p>The athlete earns most of his wealth through his professional career as a runner.</p><p>Although his exact net worth estimation is unknown, many sources estimate it between $1 million and $5 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, he does not have a fixed salary, and his income mostly depends on the magnitude of the races he runs.

The Olympic gold medalist expressed that he was very proud and excited to be a Nike athlete.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Matthew was also a part of the Nike Oregon Project.
