One of their earliest appearances together was at a Helping Hands event in 1992 (when Blaize was just a few months old). In the throwback photo, a young Raven-Symoné can be seen kissing her little brother on the cheek as he sits in his stroller.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Almost a decade later, the duo stepped out together again as they attended the premiere of Raven-Symoné’s 2001 film Dr. Dolittle 2.
