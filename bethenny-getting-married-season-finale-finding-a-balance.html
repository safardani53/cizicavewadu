As usual, a THG intern has reviewed the episode in depth, sharing her snark with readers below. Take it away!</p><p>I have to say that for a finale episode, this one was quasi-boring.&nbsp; A baby shower cake faux-disaster? Amateur football games on Montauk?&nbsp; Jason lathering sunscreen on Max?&nbsp; Bethenny’s much-hyped first trip away for work that we didn’t even get to see?&nbsp; Baby nurse Gina doling out post-baby sex advice?&nbsp; Yawnsville.&nbsp; However, I do love watching the new little family unit in action so that saved it from being a total dud.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the best moments are when Jason, Bethenny, Bryn, and Gina are hanging out around the apartment talking about whatever.&nbsp; I would prefer a whole show of that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p style=text-align:left>Tonight’s episode began with my second favorite gal from <a href=#>Real Housewives of New York City</a>, Ramona, coming over to visit Bethenny and the new baby.&nbsp; Almost immediately the baby gets cranky and Bethenny hands her off to Gina.&nbsp; Gina rushes the baby into a secluded room.&nbsp; The women discuss having more than one baby as well as sex post-delivery.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>Ramona is surprisingly tongue-tied as she talks about her own “relations” with Mario after she had daughter Avery.&nbsp; All in all, I like Ramona a whole lot better on the other show.&nbsp; Seeing her on Bethenny’s show is a weird experience – it feels like when you were little and you saw your teacher at the grocery store:&nbsp; startling, uncomfortable, and a teensy bit scary.</p><p style=text-align:left>Though she just gave birth two episodes ago, Bethenny has already reclaimed her flat stomach. “Look at the body on her, Gina,” says Jason.&nbsp; He then adds, “I really thought at our age or your age it would be a mess.”&nbsp; Gina nods knowingly.&nbsp; Speaking of Gina, one random factoid we’ve learned about her is that she is no fan of men trying to get on their women right after they have babies.&nbsp; She’s sort of a combo baby nurse/anti-post-pregnancy sex cop.</p><p style=text-align:left>The day of Bethenny’s baby shower has arrived.&nbsp; “I’m probably the first mom ever to have a baby shower with the baby already,” says Bethenny, verbalizing something we are all thinking.&nbsp; Of course poor, poor, poor Shawn is putting this little fiesta together.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:left>The first order of business is carefully extracting the specially-ordered-from-Los-Angeles cake.&nbsp; “OMG! (Multiple explicatives).&nbsp; We have a caketastrophe!” gasps Shawn as he realizes the design on the cake is messed up.&nbsp; He has a look of true terror on his face as he frantically tries to fix it.&nbsp; This much fussed-over cake, by the way, is insanely small.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>How many people is this supposed to feed?&nbsp; Or is it just a centerpiece?&nbsp; If it’s a centerpiece, then why does it have to be some extra-special cake flown in from Los Angeles?&nbsp; Such big confusion for such a little cake.&nbsp; But I digress.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>Freaky NYC Housewife Alex is among the shower guests and surprises everyone by wearing a normal outfit.&nbsp; Though Bethenny states, “I’m hoping we can have a cocktail and discuss something that doesn’t involve diapers and boobies,” of course this sort of talk is inevitable.&nbsp; But then, like in every good Housewife show, the conversation moves to sex.&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m not having sex and Jason is like a rabid animal.&nbsp; He’s gonna like mount me the second it starts,” Bethenny says in full listening zone of her mother-in-law.</p><p style=text-align:left>The shower also involves manicures, pedicures, facials, massages, and other sorts of body treatments.&nbsp; Having arrived moments earlier, assistant Max is immediately splayed out on a massage table awaiting his turn.&nbsp; Bethenny is ticked that he went ahead of her shower guests.&nbsp; Despite being bitched out, Max is oblivious and still wants the massage.</p><p style=text-align:left>After the shower, Bethenny is stressing about having to go to Chicago on a brief work trip.&nbsp; “It’s complete trauma and terror and I don’t want to go,” Bethenny says about leaving Bryn for the first time. As usual, Jason is totally supportive and wonderful.&nbsp; “We’ll be right here when you get back,” he says as he expertly pats the baby’s back.&nbsp; Gina also gives Bethenny a pep talk before she leaves.&nbsp; Lord knows if that baby is safe with anyone, it’s Gina.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span>It feels like Bethenny was only gone for the length of one commercial break because nothing about her trip is shown.&nbsp; She is thrilled to be home and to have her little baby burrito safely in her arms again. Having gained a newfound clarity as a wife and a mom, she decides her book – the one she pushed so hard to finish before the wedding – is no longer relevant because it includes neither her marriage nor her baby, the two most important events of her life.<p style=text-align:left>Later, Bethenny and Max head down to the Children’s Place to get some clothes for Bryn.&nbsp; This is surprising to me.&nbsp; Shouldn’t she be going to Bonpoint or Petit Bateau or something else a little ritzier? Regardless of the venue, Bethenny is very confused about baby sizing.&nbsp; “I have a baby,” Bethenny says to a salesgirl.&nbsp; “What do normal people do?&nbsp; They come in here and get clothes for what age?”</p><p style=text-align:left>Shopping at a regular person store has its advantages, Bethenny discovers.&nbsp; “The prices are really reasonable.&nbsp; I mean, five dollars for anything?&nbsp; You can’t get a latte for five dollars.&nbsp; This is a pair of pants.”&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:left>The family is planning a trip to Montauk, evidently the most non-Hamptons part of the Hamptons, whatever that means.&nbsp; This vacation marks the first family road trip and the car is stuffed full of baby gear.&nbsp; “We’re terrified of all the stuff we have to bring,” says Jason.&nbsp; According to him, the list of “crap” to bring includes the baby nurse and the baby.&nbsp; The huge amount of baby paraphernalia and luggage fills both a full-sized Suburban and the Skinny Girl Volkswagen Bug.</p><p style=text-align:left>While on the road they realize they forgot the baby’s crib.&nbsp; “We forgot to pack something for the baby to sleep in besides a garbage can,” Bethenny says.&nbsp; Then they realize that Bethenny also forgot her “Breast Friend” which helps prop up the baby when she’s nursing.&nbsp; “The people in the bush didn’t have a Breast Friend,” Bethenny says in an attempt to comfort herself.</p><p style=text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:left>They arrive at the Montauk Yacht Club ready to hurry up and relax.&nbsp; They hang out with the two assistants, Julie and Max and then play football.&nbsp; Bethenny is playing in a dress.&nbsp; Julie is kicking Bethenny’s ass.&nbsp; Cookie frolics nearby.&nbsp; It’s kind of boring.</p><p style=text-align:left>That evening everyone has dinner together.&nbsp; Bethenny is in a reflective mood.&nbsp; She says, “A lot has changed.&nbsp; And I’m really happy with where my life is.”&nbsp; Bethenny then officially thanks Gina for being an amazing nurse, Max for not being such a dumbass anymore, Julie for being dependable and all-around fabulous, Jason for being an amazing husband and father, and to baby Bryn for being such a cute little burrito.&nbsp; “The future can be whatever I make it,” Bethenny concludes.</p><p style=text-align:left>Ah, so there was the first season of Bethenny Getting Married?.&nbsp; I wonder if this show will have any sort of future or if it’s done for good.&nbsp; I kind of hope it’s finished, knowing how reality shows tend to kill marriages.&nbsp; Regardless, I have a few burning questions still left unanswered:</p><p style=text-align:left>-What exactly is Jason’s job?<br>-Why the hell did they put a question mark in the title of this show?<br>-What do Bethenny’s two assistants do all day long, especially when Bethenny is hanging around the house with the baby?<br>-How much do those assistants get paid?<br>-What does Gina really think of her employers and how they make her sleep on a lousy fold-out couch?<br>-Is Bethenny really friends with Ramona and Alex or is this something forced upon her to keep the other show relevant?<br>-What really went down between Bethenny and her supposedly-nuts mom?<br>-Will Bethenny really completely scrap that book she worked so long and hard on?<br>-Will Bethenny chip in any money for poor Shawn’s shock therapy treatments and/or heavy mood-stabilizing medication after torturing him so severely?<br>-How long will this cute family unit stay cute and stay a unit?&nbsp; Only time will tell!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2poX2WFcK7ErZ%2Bepp6ueqix062gp59doq6zvsiem2arlZbAsLqMn6CnmZyaeqe1zZ2gp59dlnqjrcuapZydXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbethenny-getting-married-season-finale-finding-a-balance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbethenny-getting-married-season-finale-finding-a-balance.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbethenny-getting-married-season-finale-finding-a-balance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbethenny-getting-married-season-finale-finding-a-balance.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbethenny-getting-married-season-finale-finding-a-balance.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbethenny-getting-married-season-finale-finding-a-balance.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bloody-osiris.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bloody-osiris.html>Bloody Osiris</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jonah-hills-recent-streetstyle-looks-are-going-viral-see-the-talked-about-looks.html>See Jonah Hill's Head-Turning Street Style</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jonah-hills-recent-streetstyle-looks-are-going-viral-see-the-talked-about-looks.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
