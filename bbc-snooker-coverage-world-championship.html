Really, the BBC are just SO bad at sports coverage!"</p><p>A second scathingly tweeted: "Just watched a 147 live on Eurosport, BBC are useless."</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>CASINO SPECIAL - BEST ONLINE CASINOS FOR 2023</a></strong></p><p>Another added: "Was so lucky to see it, thanks to Eurosport though. The BBC for some reason decided to show some 'comic' pre-recorded video explaining how to use the rest instead of the live #147<br>Still, makes a change from them cutting games off to show gardening shows!"</p><p><a href=#>BBC</a> bosses <a href=#>came under fire from snooker supporters</a> on the opening day when Ronnie O’Sullivan's first-round clash with Chinese debutant Pang Junxu was replaced at 9pm on the Saturday night for a subtitled Danish crime drama.</p><p>Wilson, who was defeated by O’Sullivan in the 2020 final, will receive a £55,000 bonus – £40,000 for the maximum and £10,000 for the highest-break of the 17-day tournament – but that will be shared if someone clears up before May 1.</p><p>Eurosport had been showing the match between Lisowski and Thailand's Noppon but that conveniently stopped for a mid-session break and controllers were able to switch over as No.7 seed Wilson was on 73.</p><p>When the 16th and final black was sunk, the crowd rose to their feet and Wilson shook the hands of the referee and opponent Day and then high-fived punters in the front-row seats as he went backstage.</p><p>Neil Robertson had hit two 146 breaks in his first-round win over Wu Yize -- Day did the same in qualifying -- but neither of those players will receive any extra cash by organisers now.</p><p>The Kettering cueist said: “Now that I’ve children, I’ve said for a long time I’d love to leave a legacy behind.</p><p>“I’d love to leave something for them to watch back when they have kids. And that’s going to be one of those moments.</p><p>“It’s definitely a bucket-list thing to try to do – to make a 147 at the crucible. There’s no pressure like it to be honest.</p><p>“Without a doubt, that was one of the best things I’ve ever done in my career. I got down for the pink and couldn’t feel my right arm. The black was perfect. Happy days.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>A BBC spokesperson said: "We clearly signposted to audiences that they could continue watching the live coverage on the Red Button and BBC iPlayer.&nbsp;</p><p>"We covered the story on the BBC Sport Website, with the full break available to watch again."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zfJdycHBrX5evpHnSp6aoo5WneqS71Z6pmp%2BVYsSwvsudZJygkaK9qrvNrJ%2BiqF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbbc-snooker-coverage-world-championship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbbc-snooker-coverage-world-championship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbbc-snooker-coverage-world-championship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbbc-snooker-coverage-world-championship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbbc-snooker-coverage-world-championship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbbc-snooker-coverage-world-championship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gemma-collins-birthday-party-fat-tony.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gemma-collins-birthday-party-fat-tony.html>Inside Gemma Collins' boozy birthday party at her 1.35m Essex home with celebrity guests and world</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-trish-stratus-dating.html>Who is Trish Stratus Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-trish-stratus-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
