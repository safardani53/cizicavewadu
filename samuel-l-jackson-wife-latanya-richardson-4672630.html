Jackson</strong></a>&nbsp;is one of the most talented actors in Hollywood. The 73-year-old star has appeared in over 150 films, including the popular&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Star Wars</a> franchise as Jedi Mace Windu&nbsp;and the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> as Nick Fury. Samuel’s fame also comes from movies like&nbsp;Goodfellas,&nbsp;The Red Violin,&nbsp;Jurassic Park,&nbsp;Django Unchained, and&nbsp;Pulp Fiction, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Samuel has also done voice acting in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Incredibles</a>,&nbsp;Turbo, and more animated films. Talk about an impressive career!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>But that’s not all Samuel’s accomplished in his lifetime. He’s created a wonderful family with his wife<strong>&nbsp;</strong>of over four decades,&nbsp;<strong>LaTanya Richardson</strong>, 72.&nbsp;The <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>power couple</a> has one daughter together. LaTanya also works in the entertainment industry, though she’s nowhere near as famous as her talented hubby. Read on to find out more about LaTanya, including details about her everlasting marriage to Samuel L. Jackson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LaTanya-Richardson-samuel-l-jackson-ss-embed-1.jpg><h2><strong><strong>LaTanya is an actress & producer.</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>LaTanya has been working in Hollywood since the late 1980’s. Like her husband, she’s appeared in numerous films. Her biggest on-screen role was as Paulina Pritchett in the 2003 musical film&nbsp;<i>The Fighting Temptations</i> which also starred <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cuba Gooding Jr.</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Beyonce</strong></a>. LaTanya’s also appeared in TV shows such as&nbsp;Law & Order,&nbsp;Ally McBeal, Blue Bloods, and most recently,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grey’s Anatomy</a>.&nbsp;She was in A Raisin in the Sun&nbsp;on&nbsp;Broadway and got a nomination at the 2014 Tony Awards for Best Actress in a Play. As a producer, LaTanya most recently worked on the 2020 TV documentary&nbsp;Enslaved, which starred her husband. As an actress, LaTanya has joked about how much her husband takes pride in his work, as they both treat their projects as “jobs,” but she said that Samuel throws himself into each one in a March 2022 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. She said that Samuel “loves every job he does,” before joking about one of his most famed roles. “Snakes on a Plane, I’m like, ‘Really?”</p><h2><strong><strong>LaTanya met Samuel in college.</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>LaTanya studied at Spelman College, the oldest private historically black liberal arts college for women in Atlanta, Georgia. Samuel was at the all-male Morehouse College in Atlanta. They met in 1970 despite being at separate universities. They started dating fairly quickly after and enjoyed a sweet romance together that carried them to 1980, which was when they took their relationship to the next level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LaTanya-Richardson-samuel-l-jackson-ss-embed-2.jpg><h2><strong><strong>LaTanya & Samuel got married in 1980.</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>After dating for 10 years, LaTanya and Samuel said “I do” on August 18, 1980. Not much is known about the couple’s wedding ceremony, but we can assume it was a beautiful event. Samuel celebrated the couple’s 40-year wedding anniversary on Instagram in August 2020. He posted photos of the couple dancing and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a sweet message</a> to LaTanya. “HAPPY ANNIVERSARY @ltjackson_ Love 💕 You for keeping me on my toes & on the beat for 18,250 days. You make my soul 🎶 sing‼️Don’t change the tune, we’re not done dancing,” the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Avengers: Endgame</a>&nbsp;actor wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>After over 40 years of marriage, the pair said that they wanted to change the narrative about Black families and be an example of a nuclear family. “We always said the most revolutionary thing that Black people could do was stay together, raise their children with the nucleus of having a father and a mother, since everybody likes to pretend that that’s not the dynamic of the African American family,” LaTanya told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>&nbsp;in March 2022. “In order to change that narrative, we made a decision to say, ‘We are going to stay together no matter what. We’ll figure it out.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Samuel also opened up about why their marriage works so well, and it’s simply because of their strong bond. “It’s two people who respect each other, love each other and look out for each other,” he told&nbsp;People.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>But marriage hasn’t always been easy on Samuel and LaTanya. The couple hit a rough patch during the early 1990s when Samuel was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>struggling with drug addiction</a>. Things got especially bad when he overdrank and nearly did coke at actor/writer <strong>Ruben Santiago-Hudson</strong>‘s bachelor party. “I went by the spot, copped, went home, cooked the sh*t, and passed out before I had even smoked it, drunk. That’s when my wife and daughter found me on the floor,” he previously recalled to&nbsp;<i><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>.&nbsp;</i>24 hours that incident, LaTanya got her husband checked into a rehab facility. “I threatened to leave him if he didn’t see the rehab through,” she told the publication. “I knew I couldn’t leave this boy I admired so much. But I resented him too. I hated it when he slurred his words. A wife hates to see her husband be weak.” Samuel eventually got clean and reunited with LaTanya.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LaTanya-Richardson-samuel-l-jackson-ss-embed-3.jpg><h2><strong><strong>LaTanya & Samuel have one child.</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>LaTanya and Samuel are the proud parents of daughter <strong>Zoe Jackson</strong>, 39. Zoe works as a co-executive producer on the hit Bravo shows <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Project Runway</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Top Chef</a>&nbsp;and on VH1’s RuPaul’s Drag Race. She’s won 3 Emmy Awards for her work on the latter two shows.&nbsp;Zoe was previously a producer on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Bachelorette</a>&nbsp;for season 13, which starred&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rachel Lindsay</strong></a>. LaTanya and Samuel’s daughter&nbsp;is on Instagram, but unlike her famous parents, she has <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a private account</a>. The actors did reveal that they have a yearly ritual to take a month off from work in the summer in a March 2022 interview with&nbsp;People. “Don’t wake anybody up. You sleep when you sleep. Then we come together and eat,” Samuel explained as the rule for their vacations.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>After Zoe and the&nbsp;<i>Drag Race&nbsp;</i>team won an Emmy for Outstanding Competition Program in 2021, proud mom LaTanya posted a picture of the trophy on Instagram and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>congratulated her daughter</a>. “Lately, I’ve had sadness but today I smile. ‘She Came’ Good job Zoe. I smile at the recognition,” LaTanya said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KapK6dnGK5brbAnKKsp55ixKqyxGajmqyRo8aiedGimqGZopnAsLqMbW1wamZofXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsamuel-l-jackson-wife-latanya-richardson-4672630.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsamuel-l-jackson-wife-latanya-richardson-4672630.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsamuel-l-jackson-wife-latanya-richardson-4672630.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsamuel-l-jackson-wife-latanya-richardson-4672630.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsamuel-l-jackson-wife-latanya-richardson-4672630.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsamuel-l-jackson-wife-latanya-richardson-4672630.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./5xorsqrmhgzswm8imqco-coy4k-09cij.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./5xorsqrmhgzswm8imqco-coy4k-09cij.html>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./espinoza-paz-19811029-html.html>Espinoza Paz (Cantante de Msica Mundial) - Edad, cumpleaos, biografa, hechos, familia, patrimo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./espinoza-paz-19811029-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
