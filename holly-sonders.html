As a golf channel sportscaster, she had time for two questions.</p><p>The question that created a buzz was that he asked whether he had packed an outfit in case of a Monday playoff.</p><p>The very question was still; hence, they had an awkward post-interview hug by the end of the interview as they parted ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Jordan-Spieth-Interview.jpg><h3>Mispronunciation</h3><p>When you start on live television or host a show, every eye flickers around you, and even a single tongue slip or miss lead becomes a moment that is forever floating around the internet.</p><p>When I say so, everyone who has watched the live screen of Sports knows the moment with Holly Sonders.</p><p>Let me take you back to the short glimpse of the year 2018 when she had a miserable tongue slip during the live host of the FS1 2018 U.S.</p><p>Open preview show.
