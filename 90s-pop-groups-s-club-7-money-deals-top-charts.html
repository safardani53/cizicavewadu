I think he looked at me like, how could I not appreciate everything ? But I just needed a little bit of help.”</p><p>And Scott was left in tears having been forced to perform on TV when his newborn son was in intensive care.</p><p>He said: “I remember a call when I was at the hospital looking after him saying, ‘You’ve got to go on CD:UK and perform,’ and I was like, ‘I couldn’t give a f***, I’m not doing it.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Atomic Kitten</h2><p>THE Liverpool girl group were formed around <a href=#>Kerry Katona</a> whose ambition at the time was to be a Page 3 model.</p><p>The trio was put together by Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark’s singer Andy McCluskey in 1998.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2fbd0d34-74b1-4f16-81f3-1f5f8a545e38.jpg><p>Kerry, who was only 17 at the time, was recommended to Andy by a pal.</p><p>He recalls: “Within 60 seconds she goes, ‘Do you want to see me photos?’, and she gets out her topless photographs.” Andy admits that Kerry couldn’t sing, but felt sure, with two strong singers alongside her, that Atomic Kitten would be a hit.</p><p>Secondary school pupils <a href=#>Liz McClarnon</a> and Heidi Range were chosen, but Heidi left while rehearsing the debut album and was replaced by <a href=#>Natasha Hamilton</a>.</p><p>The book reveals the precarious nature of being in a manufactured pop group.</p><p><a href=#>Atomic Kitten</a> was on course to be dropped by their label due to poor record sales when Kerry decided to quit in 2001 after falling pregnant with <a href=#>Westlife</a> star <a href=#>Brian McFadden’s</a> baby.</p><p>Natasha asked Jenny Frost to step in for a TV performance of their fifth single Whole Again which went to No1.</p><p>Success, though, meant that management was unwilling to give Natasha the time off she needed in 2003 while suffering from postnatal depression.</p><p>Natasha claims: “It was very much, ‘The show must go on regardless, we don’t really care what’s wrong with you’.”</p><p>She quit the group, which reformed in 2012.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Blue</h2><p>IMAGE is everything in the pop world, which can be very cruel if you don’t fit in.</p><p>When Blue formed at the start of the new millennium, they were a five-piece consisting of <a href=#>Lee Ryan</a>, <a href=#>Antony Costa</a>, <a href=#>Duncan James</a> and two now-forgotten singers called Richard and Spencer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/a0452cd3-c84c-480c-9076-202b1736775d.jpg><p>The contract was about to be signed when someone from the record label decided that the other two weren’t quite right for the project.</p><p>They were dropped and <a href=#>Simon Webbe</a> was brought in to create the four-piece that everyone knows so well.</p><p>But Antony also struggled to match the high expectations of the cruel business.</p><p>He was sidelined by magazines, which refused to put him on their cover because he supposedly wasn’t handsome enough.</p><p>Antony says: “I felt like I was an easy target. I wasn’t the blond haired, blue-eyed boy or the one with the big muscles and the six pack and the chiselled jaw.”</p><p>The band were rarely out of the headlines due to their party loving and bed-hopping.</p><p>Antony recalls Lee letting off a fire extinguisher in a bar where <a href=#>Newcastle United</a> were celebrating their Christmas party and <a href=#>Alan Shearer</a> was in attendance.</p><p>He says: “They tried to do us for the dry-cleaning bill but Lee ended up paying it all, I think.”</p><p>Blue went their separate ways for various solo deals in 2005 before reforming in 2011 to represent the United Kingdom in the <a href=#>Eurovision</a> song contest.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>S Club Seven</h2><p>DESPITE enjoying four No1 singles and selling more than ten million albums, there was a never-ending demand for more hits.</p><p>After the final album failed to make the Top spot in 2003, the group split up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hp-sclub-rotate.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rachel-stevens-paul-cattermole-jo-798796679.jpg><p>Their main singer, <a href=#>Jo O’Meara</a>, says: “If you didn’t get No1 it was classed as a failure. When you think back at artists who were dropped when they only made top 20. . . it’s harsh.”</p><p>But for her it was the departure of <a href=#>Paul Cattermole</a> in 2002 that was the “beginning of the end”.</p><p>She reveals: “When Paul left we did go on for another year but it wasn’t the same.”</p><p>Paul wanted to pursue his true musical dreams by forming a heavy metal band called Skua with his old school pals.</p><p><a href=#>S Club 7</a> were often treated like employees, expected to sing the songs and appear on the TV programmes chosen by their management team.</p><p>They only received one week off a year, got up at 4am to start filming and slept between interviews.</p><p>While they sold millions of records, the band members claimed they only took home £150,000 annually.</p><p>Paul ended up bankrupt and fellow bandmate <a href=#>Hannah Spearritt</a> was left homeless last year.</p><p>But <a href=#>Bradley McIntosh</a>, who had just been sacked by Pizza Hut when he joined S Club in 1998, did escape the tyranny of the routine.</p><p>Producer Simon Ellis recalled having to hunt him down at a nightclub when he was supposed to be recording a new song.</p><p>He said: “He pitches up with this carrier bag full of beer and goes into the vocal booth.</p><p>“He was out of there by 2am and went back to the club. Great.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Steps</h2><p>The competition to be the next Spice Girls was so intense in the late 1990s that wannabe singers were desperate to get signed.</p><p><a href=#>Ian “H” Watkins</a> from <a href=#>Steps</a> says: “Everyone was auditioning for either girl bands or boy bands.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/d56e9039-d49d-485c-8e73-99430daddc55.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/claire-richards-faye-tozer-lisa-808887454.jpg><p>The five members of Steps accepted the first deal they were offered - because it was the only one on the table.</p><p>They had been touted as a line-dancing Mixed Spice and it hadn’t gone down well with record labels.</p><p><a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> turned down the act but <a href=#>Pete Waterman</a> signed them.</p><p>Most of the band couldn’t even afford a mobile phone, H was on the dole and <a href=#>Claire Richards</a> lived with her parents at the start.</p><p>It was 18 months before they saw any real money in their bank accounts, with most of their earnings going on expenses.</p><p>Claire says: “The outfit I wore in the ‘5,6,7,8’ video was the one I wore for every single club gig for months and months.</p><p>“You could probably smell me coming most of the time. When we got Top Of The Pops we begged them, ‘Please please please can we have a new outfit.’”</p><p>Claire was often up until 2.30am in the recording studio. She worked so hard that her mum worried she was taking drugs to stay awake.</p><p>But in the long run, performing on a budget paid off, because Steps ended up with more money from record sales.</p><p>The group, which also consisted of <a href=#>Lee Latchford-Evans, Faye Tozer and Lisa Scott-Lee</a>, had two No1 singles and sold 22million albums worldwide.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Spice Girls</h2><p><a href=#>Scary, Sporty, Posh, Baby and Ginger Spice</a> became the biggest British female group of all time when their debut album shifted 23million copies.</p><p>But before they were international jet-setters the five performers had to fend for themselves in a rented house in Maidenhead, <a href=#>Berks</a>, and rehearse in a church hall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/spice-girls-l-r-geri-808856580.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/iconic-girlband-spice-girls-performs-496791220.jpg><p>Baby Spice <a href=#>Emma Bunton</a> reveals: “Mel B used to cook corned beef and rice, which was a step up from my beans on toast. We used to make Victoria clean the bathroom.”</p><p>Their original manager, Chris Herbert, claims <a href=#>Geri</a> was “a bit of a wooden horse” when it came to dancing during those early days.</p><p>And <a href=#>Mel C</a> reveals that she got too drunk when invited to the Brit Awards prior to releasing their mega-selling debut album Spice in 1996.</p><p>She admits: “There were words between myself and Victoria. I think I told her where to go.”</p><p>Geri also claimed that Posh Spice, aka <a href=#>Victoria Beckham</a>, “just wasn’t there” during the recording of their most famous single Wannabe.</p><p>For Mel C one of the toughest parts of being in a group put together by a management company was having to pretend to be someone she wasn’t.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She didn’t appreciate the Sporty tag and grew tired of the commercial side of the business.</p><p>But the biggest tensions were with Geri, who quit to go solo in 1998.<br>Emma, who was close friends with Ginger Spice, says: “I just felt like she’d left me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqYW6Gc4GRaWZyaKNivbC8jKCpqK2gqHq0ecKlrJtlZ2K6sLrEsmSdnZGhwG7AzqlknKCRp8G0ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f90s-pop-groups-s-club-7-money-deals-top-charts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f90s-pop-groups-s-club-7-money-deals-top-charts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f90s-pop-groups-s-club-7-money-deals-top-charts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f90s-pop-groups-s-club-7-money-deals-top-charts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f90s-pop-groups-s-club-7-money-deals-top-charts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f90s-pop-groups-s-club-7-money-deals-top-charts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ayla-woodruff-boyfriend-age-model-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ayla-woodruff-boyfriend-age-model-html.html>Insta Model Ayla Woodruff Age 26; Real Reason Why She Left Boyfriend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./celebs-christmas-birthdays-photos.html>Celebs With Christmas Birthdays: Photos Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./celebs-christmas-birthdays-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
