Pistorius was serving a 13-year sentence for the crime, but was released early and is now out on parole.</p><p>Pistorius first came to public attention as an Olympic athlete and double amputee who competed at the highest levels of the sport while running on two carbon fiber legs. Now, Oscar is set to return to his uncle Arnold Pistorius's home. Following the news that Arnold would be taking his nephew in, many wanted to learn more about who Arnold is and about his connection to Oscar.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Oscar Pistorius's uncle Arnold?</h2><p>Arnold Pistorius is a successful businessman who owns a large property in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa. Oscar, who has an older brother and a younger sister, grew up in Arnold's care after they became estranged from their father. Arnold is their father's brother. Oscar's mother died when he was just 15 years old, after which Arnold became his primary caretaker.</p><p>Before his release, Arnold <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had announced</a> that he was preparing a room in his house that Oscar could stay in.</p><p>Arnold earned most of his wealth through developing, letting, and managing commercial properties. Arnold's property features landscaped gardens and a swimming pool, and will likely serve as an ideal setting for Oscar should he desire privacy following his release. Arnold also announced that Oscar had been offered a job, but declined to say who with.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Oscar will live under strict parole conditions until his full sentence expires.</h2><p>Although Oscar has been released years early, he's expected to remain under very strict parole supervision until December 2029, when his full sentence expires.</p><p>June Steenkamp, Reeva's mother, said that she had come to accept the news that her daughter's killer would be released on parole, even if she personally opposed the decision earlier on in the process.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p style=text-align:start>“Has there been justice for Reeva? Has Oscar served enough time? There can never be justice if your loved one is never coming back, and no amount of time served will bring Reeva back,” June Steenkamp said. “We who remain behind are the ones serving a life sentence. With the release of Oscar Pistorius on parole, my only desire is that I will be allowed to live my last years in peace with my focus remaining on the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation, to continue Reeva’s legacy.”</p><p>Oscar's parole restrictions include limitations on when he is allowed to leave his home, a ban on consuming alcohol, and mandatory anger management sessions and sessions on violence against women. Oscar is also forbidden from speaking to the media until the end of his sentence, and must also perform community service. He must meet regularly with parole officials and will also be subject to unannounced visits from authorities.</p><p>Oscar may have been released from prison, but South African authorities insist that that doesn't mean he has completed his sentence. He has strict rules to follow for the next five years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpMCkrdFmp6KrpKS%2FqsHSZqynm5ya</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foscar-pistorius-uncle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2foscar-pistorius-uncle.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2foscar-pistorius-uncle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2foscar-pistorius-uncle.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foscar-pistorius-uncle.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2foscar-pistorius-uncle.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tyriq-withers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tyriq-withers.html>Tyriq Withers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./annie-kilner.html>Annie Kilner- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./annie-kilner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
