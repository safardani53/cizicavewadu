<time>28 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Harris Dickinson is an English actor, writer, and director who has mainly gained fame through his acting performances. He first tasted the limelight in 2017 when he played the role of Frankie, a young man struggling with his sexuality, in the movie Beach Rats.</p><p>For his amazing performance in it, he won several awards, including one CinEuphoria Award, ALFS Award, and Golden Carp Film Award – International. He was also nominated for the Evening Standard British Film Award, Independent Spirit Award, Gotham Independent Film Award, and OFTA Film Award.</p><p>Since his rise to fame, he has played in movies and TV shows such as Trust (2018), The Darkest Minds (2018), The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (2019), County Lines (2019), Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (2019), The King’s Man (2021), and See How They Run (2022).</p><p>Likewise, he recently appeared in two movies – Scrapper and The Iron Claw – and one TV mini-series, A Murder at the End of the World. Soon, he will make his appearance in Babygirl, which is currently in production, and Blitz, which is currently in post-production.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Harris Dickinson?</h2><p>Dickinson is 27 years of age as of this writing. He celebrates his birthday on the 24th of June every year. Born in 1996, he spent most of his childhood in the suburbs of Leytonstone, Essex, England. As per his date of birth, his zodiac sign is Cancer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/harris-dickinson-gay-rumors-girlfriend-parents-age.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Harris Dickinson during one of his photoshoots (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>As for his education, he is a high school dropout who quit school at the age of 17 to pursue a career in film and theatre. But halfway through, he decided to join the Royal Marines. Nonetheless, his RAW Academy coach motivated him, and he pursued acting again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Harris Dickinson is one of three children of his parents</h2><p>Harris was born to his parents, Garry Hartshorn and Teresa Dickinson Hartshorn. The actor is not the kind of person who has openly shared details related to his family life. However, he can occasionally be seen sharing pictures of his parents.</p><p>Reports from online outlets suggest that his father is a social worker and his mother is a hairdresser. It is also reported that his biological parents are separated, and he has a stepfather. Nonetheless, all of these details are yet to be verified and confirmed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Apart from his parents, he has two older siblings: brothers named Max Dickinson and Sonny Dickinson. He is close to both of them, which is evident from his Instagram posts. Besides these, not many details are known about his family life, including his parents and siblings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How tall is Harris Dickinson?</h2><p>The Matthias & Maxime star stands at a towering height of 6 feet or 1.83 meters. Additionally, he has an athletic build body and weighs around 71 kg or 156.5 lbs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Harris Dickinson gay?</h2><p>After Dickinson played the role of a young man struggling with his sexuality in the 2017 movie Beach Rats, many were amazed by his performance.</p><p>However, as the performance was brilliant, it also led many to assume that his on-screen portrayal might have something to do with his off-screen matters. People began to ask and wonder if the actor was gay in real life.</p><p>Dickinson’s sexuality became a debatable topic across different social media platforms, including Reddit and Twitter. These gay speculations were further fueled following his performance in the 2018 movie Postcards from London, where he once again played a homosexual character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Harris-Dickinson-in-the-middle-during-a-Still-from-Postcards-From-London.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Harris Dickinson, in the middle, in a still from ‘Postcards From London’ (Photo: Another Man)</p><p>So, is Harris Dickinson gay? The straightforward answer is “No.” The actor isn’t gay, and his sexual orientation is straight. Besides, he has a girlfriend with whom he has been together for a very long time.</p><p>That said, Dickinson has a positive view of LGBTQ and its representation. For instance, during his 2018 <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.anothermanmag.com/life-culture/10588/harris-dickinson-actor-postcards-from-london-film-interview-2018 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Another Man</a> Magazine, he talked about playing a gay role as a straight man.</p><p>He mentioned, “If you are playing a gay character, or queer, as you said, there is a certain responsibility to represent it correctly – whether that means representing a struggle or representing the truth of the situation.”</p><p>As the interview continued, he talked about both his characters in Beach Rats and Postcards from London and gave a little more thought to what those two homosexual characters felt and went through.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inside Harris Dickinson’s dating life</h2><p>As mentioned above, Dickinson has been in a relationship with his girlfriend for a long time. His girlfriend’s name is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rose Gray</a>, a fellow Englishman who is a musician by profession. Before this, there are no details of Dickinson’s previous relationships.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As per reports, Dickinson and his partner, Gray, began dating each other around 2013. On July 26, 2014, the actor posted his girlfriend’s picture on Instagram for the very first time. He had captioned the picture, “This is my mate; she’s also my girlfriend funnily enough.”</p><p>Ever since they began dating, the couple has been together, holding each other’s hands as they traveled to different places, celebrated festivals and birthdays, and always supported each other.</p><p>The two could be seen featuring each other several times on their respective Instagram handles. In addition, Dickinson has even helped his musician girlfriend by filming some of her music videos.</p><p>For instance, Dickinson recently directed a music video for his girlfriend Rose Gray. The music video was for ‘Afraid Of Nothing’ by Gray & Kungs. The <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOT3PKobA-k" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">music video</a> was released on October 19, 2023.</p><p>A couple of days later, on October 22, Gray took to her Instagram handle to <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cys_-yuN8Hj/?img_index=1" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">share</a> some behind-the-camera photos from the music video shoot. While the post helped increase some views on YouTube, it led many to speculate if Dickinson and his partner got married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Harris-Dickinson-girlfriend-Rose-Gray-wedding-dress.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Harris Dickinson with his girlfriend Rose Gray, who is wearing a wedding dress (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>The reason why some thought that way was because Gray was donning a wedding dress. Some started asking, “Is Harris Dickinson married?” But, rest assured, the long-time couple – who live together in London – is yet to walk down the aisle and share their wedding vows.</p><p>Speaking of ‘Afraid Of Nothing,’ the power couple recently <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hungertv.com/editorial/rose-gray-and-harris-dickinson-are-musics-coolest-couple/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sat down with</a> Hunger and talked about it. Gray mentioned that Dickinson came up with the idea for the music video, and they turned it around in two to three weeks.</p><p>All in all, considering all they’ve been through, it’s evident that they have bonded very well in what has been almost a decade. So, the day might not be that far when Dickinson and Gray get engaged and ultimately married as well.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is Harris Dickinson’s net worth?</h2><p>Since his debut in 2014, Dickinson has only worked his way upwards. Currently, he sits with a total of 27 acting credits to his <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6170168/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDb profile</a>, including two of his upcoming projects.</p><p>Considering that, he might also have made a decent net worth. Well, as per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the actor has an estimated net worth of $3 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrqKpfna6zvsisZJ2hk6C2r7%2FOp2Sgmaliv7a5zquqZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1loJa%2FprrTrGSan5Vk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fharris-dickinson-gay-rumors-girlfriend-parents-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fharris-dickinson-gay-rumors-girlfriend-parents-age.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fharris-dickinson-gay-rumors-girlfriend-parents-age.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fharris-dickinson-gay-rumors-girlfriend-parents-age.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fharris-dickinson-gay-rumors-girlfriend-parents-age.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fharris-dickinson-gay-rumors-girlfriend-parents-age.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./see-new-photo-of-jack-black-with-his-mother-and-learn-her-fascinating-story-exclusive-8419053.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./see-new-photo-of-jack-black-with-his-mother-and-learn-her-fascinating-story-exclusive-8419053.html>See a New Photo of Jack Black with His Mother and Learn Her Fascinating Story (Exclusive)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./yellowjackets.html>Teen Taissa Played by Jasmin Savoy Brown - Yellowjackets</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./yellowjackets.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
