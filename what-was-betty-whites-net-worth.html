She would be celebrating 100 years old on January 17, 2022.</p><p>At the time of her death, White had accrued a net worth of an estimated $75million and received critical acclaim over the course of her long career.</p><p>Over the years, she received a total of eight Emmy Awards, three American Comedy Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and one Grammy Award. She received her first award in 1983 for the game show Just Men.</p><p>Her second award was for a Primetime Emmy in 1986 for Best Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Rose Nylund in Golden Girls.</p><h2>What was her cause of death?</h2><p>White's death was first confirmed in a statement to PEOPLE by her agent Jeff Witjas.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more from betty white</h2></p><p>"Even though Betty was about to be 100, I thought she would live forever," Witjas wrote at the time.</p><p>"I will miss her terribly and so will the animal world that she loved so much. I <a href=#>don't think Betty ever feared passing</a> because she always wanted to be with her most beloved husband <a href=#>Allen Ludden</a>. She believed she would be with him again."&nbsp;</p><p>At first, rumors started to spread that she passed away following complications from a Covid-19 booster shot, <a href=#>however, the rumors were quickly shut down by Witjas</a> in a follow-up statement on January 3.</p><p>"<a href=#>Betty died peacefully in her sleep at her home</a>," Witjas revealed. "People are saying her death was related to getting a booster shot three days earlier but that is not true. She died of natural causes."</p><p>He later added: "Her death should not be politicized — that is not the life she lived."</p><h2>How did Betty White Spend her time and money?</h2><p><a href=#>The Golden Girls actress</a> was a minimalist and said her secret to a long life consisted of a diet of hot dogs, french fries, and a vodka martini.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Closer Weekly</a> in 2020, White's friend said, “Betty loves to joke that vodka keeps her young.</p><p>“She loves the image of her sitting at home in a rocking chair, drinking a martini, and watching game shows, but she’s not really a big drinker.</p><p>"That’s not her. She’ll only take a few sips of a cocktail if the occasion calls for it.”</p><p>Her childlike diet also consisted of canned tomato soup with grilled cheese sandwiches alongside the occasional crossword puzzle.</p><p>Her home was also reported to be worth millions as she showed a video on her TV special, Betty's Happy Hour.</p><p>In the 2017 TV special, she showed off her <a href=#>California</a> home, using comedy to introduce the house. "I’m Betty White. Welcome to my crib," she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000703217648.jpg><h2>What was Betty White known for?</h2><p><a href=#>White was predominantly known</a> for her role in Golden Girls and the Mary Tyler Moore Show, but her accolades stem far deeper than that, showing a career of tenacity.</p><p>In the 1950s, White was heavily criticized for including Arthur Duncan, a Black dancer, on The Betty White Show.</p><p>When she was told to pull him from the show, she gave a resounding "no" and gave Duncan more air time.</p><p>In the 2018 documentary, Betty White: First Lady of Television, she and Duncan spoke about the incident.</p><p>"All through the South there was this whole ruckus, they were going to take the show off the air if we didn’t get rid of Arthur because he was Black,” White said in the documentary.</p><p>Duncan added, “People in the South, some of them resented me being on the show and wanted me thrown out. And it was never a question at all.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But White said her opinion was never going to change and Duncan was staying.</p><p>“Evidently through the South at that point, it was a very heavy (thing), and I said, ‘I’m sorry, but he stays … Live with it!’”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsY2yAcoWXaK6hmaRixKK%2FjJucraypYsSptdOeqmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-betty-whites-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dan-osborne-heartbroken-nan-dies-coronavirus.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dan-osborne-heartbroken-nan-dies-coronavirus.html>Dan Osborne is heartbroken as his nan dies of coronavirus and his granddad misses her 'like mad'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./trace-adkins-daughters-html.html>Trace Adkins Shows Love for His Daughters in His Songs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./trace-adkins-daughters-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
