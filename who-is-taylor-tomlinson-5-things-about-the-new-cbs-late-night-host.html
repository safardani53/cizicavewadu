I was on TikTok searching, like, ‘How to nail a job interview’ — TikTok is Google for children — and, ‘How to impress your maybe boss,’” she told Colbert.</p><p>Keep reading for everything to know about Tomlinson:</p><h3>1.

Where Is Taylor Tomlinson From?</h3><p>Tomlinson grew up in Temecula, California, and has used stories from her upbringing in her comedy. “I did not grow up in a household that was very, like, <a href=#>mental health conscious</a>. Like, we were very religious,” she stated in her March 2022 <a href=# rel=noopener>Look at You special</a>. “I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to tell your conservative dad that you have a mental health issue. It doesn’t go great.”</p><p>She continued: “When I was in high school, I was like, ‘Dad, I think I’m depressed.’ And he was like, ‘You just need some protein. Get a scoop of peanut butter. Yeah, there’s a lot of dads out there just white-knuckling it through life right now, clinging to a jar of chunky Jif like it’s the answer, just a buoy in the storm. ‘It’ll pass.’”</p><h3>3. What Is Taylor Tomlinson’s Signature Look?</h3><p>Tomlinson has been known to rock several stylish jackets during her stand-up shows, most notably a classic, <a href=#>black leather jacket</a>. “In case anyone needs last minute costume ideas,” she captioned an October 2023 <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> post featuring a fake <a href=#>Spirit Halloween</a> costume of herself.</p><p>According to the costume’s description, all fans need to dress as Tomlinson for Halloween are “1 leather jacket, 1 pair of black jeans, 1 pair of ankle boots, 1 tank top, 1 hair tie, 1 pair of arm floaties [and] 1 microphone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Who-Is-Taylor-Tomlinson-5-Things-About-the-New-CBS-Late-Night-Host-3.jpg><h3>4. What Will Taylor Tomlinson’s Show ‘After Midnight’ Be About?</h3><p>After Midnight will be based on the Comedy Central series At Midnight (@midnight) with <a href=#>Chris Hardwick</a>, which ran for four seasons from 2013 to 2017. Colbert will serve as co-executive produce the show with his wife, <strong>Evelyn McGee Colbert</strong>, @midnight cocreator <strong>Jason U. Nadler</strong>, Spartina Industries president <strong>Carrie Byalick</strong>, The Late Show executive <strong>Tom Purcell</strong>, <strong>James Dixon</strong> of Dixon Talent and Funny or Die’s <strong>Joe Farrell</strong>, <strong>Mike Farah</strong>, <strong>Whitney Hodack</strong> and <strong>Henry R. Muñoz III</strong>.</p><p>“My hope is that, every night, After Midnight will be just as ridiculous as the internet is every day,” Colbert stated in CBS’ November 2023 press release. “Plus, the original @midnight aired after <a href=#>The Colbert Report</a>, so welcoming this new show to 12:30 feels like coming home.” (Colbert previously hosted Comedy Central’s The Colbert Report from 2005 to 2014.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Who-Is-Taylor-Tomlinson-5-Things-About-the-New-CBS-Late-Night-Host-2.jpg><h3>5.

I also told you the best part of having one of these jobs is being able to find and hire really good people,” Colbert told Tomlinson before showing viewers a hilarious pic of her shocked reaction to the news.</p><p>“It’s such a beautiful photo. I want to have a caption contest. ‘What is going through her mind? What is she reacting to?’” Colbert stated, to which Tomlinson followed up by poking fun at her appearance on the call.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“’When you log onto the Zoom and realize you should’ve dried your hair and put on more makeup,’ is what’s actually happening,” she stated, noting that she initially thought Colbert was calling her to “let her down easy.”</p><p>Tomlinson later celebrated her new role via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. “I got a job 😮,” she captioned a pic from her Late Late Show appearance, as well as her funny Zoom reaction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoJ9itrR505qwpaeiYsGwucuipaynnmKCbsDHoqWgq12Wr7DB02aroZ1do7K4ecKbqmakkamybrrIoJ%2BtZZikwLV7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-taylor-tomlinson-5-things-about-the-new-cbs-late-night-host.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-taylor-tomlinson-5-things-about-the-new-cbs-late-night-host.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-taylor-tomlinson-5-things-about-the-new-cbs-late-night-host.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-taylor-tomlinson-5-things-about-the-new-cbs-late-night-host.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-taylor-tomlinson-5-things-about-the-new-cbs-late-night-host.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-taylor-tomlinson-5-things-about-the-new-cbs-late-night-host.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./donald-trump-a-new-grandfather-to-kai-madison.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./donald-trump-a-new-grandfather-to-kai-madison.html>A New Grandfather to Kai Madison</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-did-sweet-lady-jane-close.html>Loyal Customers of the Sweet Lady Jane Bakery Don't Believe the Shop's Reasons for Closing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-did-sweet-lady-jane-close.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
