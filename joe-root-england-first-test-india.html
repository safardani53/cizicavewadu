<time>18 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>JOE ROOT scored one of the best centuries of his life and dragged England back into the First Test virtually on his own.</p><p>Even <a href=#>Root</a> must have realised how good it was as he celebrated with air punches, bat waves to his family, and a kiss on the badge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000671693169.jpg><p>Captain Root is so far ahead of the rest of his team in terms of class, style, and productivity that it has become almost embarrassing.</p><p>Such has been Root’s domination of England’s Test match scoring in 2021 that he has 1,064 runs while the next best is Dom Sibley with 345.</p><p>Root has become like Atlas, the Greek God condemned to hold up the heavens for eternity. He is a God of batting, with the weight of his team on his shoulders.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>JOIN SUN VEGAS: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET A FREE £10 BONUS WITH 100s OF GAMES TO PLAY AND NO DEPOSIT REQUIRED</a></strong> (Ts&Cs apply)</p><p>He came in with England in trouble against a high-quality attack in tricky conditions and he batted magnificently.</p><p>Root was eventually out for 109 in the first over with the second new ball and the next highest score was Sam Curran’s 32.</p><p>It almost goes without saying that Root was top-scorer in England’s first innings as well with 64.</p><p>Then Stuart Broad, wearing his lucky white headband for the first time this summer, had opener K.L.Rahul caught behind with an absolute beauty in the closing minutes.</p><p>India will resume at Trent Bridge on Sunday needing another 157 to win. They are favourites but, without Root, England might already have lost.</p><p>It was a captivating day of Test cricket without a single break for weather - even though the forecast was for wet and gloom.</p><p>I was probably a little too excited with my celebration. But the atmosphere in the ground was fantastic and I felt good with rhythm back in my batting</p><span class=quote-credit>Joe Root</span><p>Root said: “In the context of the game, it felt a very good innings. This morning, I said to the group that we should all remember that batting is fun. It might be hard but it is fun.</p><p>“I was probably a little too excited with my celebration. But the atmosphere in the ground was fantastic and I felt good with rhythm back in my batting. I’ve worked hard on that.</p><p>“I know we’ve been going through quite a rough patch as a batting group but it’is not through lack of effort. The guys have been working extremely hard and I’m sure the runs will come.</p><p>“There’s been a lot to handle in recent weeks with Covid and everything else, not just for me but for the whole squad. It’s important you find some solutions and ways of managing things.</p><p>“We’d like more runs but it feels like there will be nine more chances to take wickets. The pitch is still doing a bit and wickets have fallen in clusters throughout the match.”</p><p>England began the day still 75 behind with ten wickets in hand but Rory Burns soon nicked off and Zak Crawley followed. Crawley is averaging just 11 in Test cricket this year, the sort of stat that puts extra pressure on Root to deliver.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000671714855.jpg><p>Sibley was given out lbw on 24 but DRS showed the ball to be missing the stumps. The Warwickshire opener remained virtually strokeless until he attempted an out-of-character drive and wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant held the inside edge diving to his left.</p><p>Sibley and Root put on 89 in 174 for the third wicket of which Sibley contributed 12 from 82 deliveries.</p><p>Apart from almost playing on a couple of times early in his innings and a skittish ten minutes before lunch, Root’s 21st Test century was flawless. It was his first at home for three years.</p><p>Jonny Bairstow looked good for a while and had a verbal battle with Mohammed Siraj, who is nothing if not chatty on the field.</p><p>He later gave Jimmy Anderson an earful when he came out to bat and the umpires told him to zip it.</p><p>Bairstow nailed a pull shot against Siraj but watched in horror as the ball bee-lined into Ravi Jadeja’s hands at deep square leg. On this occasion, instead of chirping at Bairstow, Siraj put his finger to his lips.</p><p>Dan Lawrence looked anxious but managed a couple of sweet shots before departing lbw. Jos Buttler was bowled without offering a shot.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Cricket</h2></p><p>Root reached three figures from 154 balls with a classic on drive for four and he was already celebrating with the ball 30 yards short of the boundary.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Root furiously swished his bat when he edged the superb Jasprit Bumrah. He wanted to extend England’s lead by at least another 50 runs.</p><p>Curran was aggressive before popping a catch to mid-on but Broad’s stumps were shattered first ball. Ollie Robinson was last man out when he slashed to third man.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Joe Root wishes Ben Stokes gets well soon after he takes a break from cricket</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH52hI9xa2ptX5%2B8pnnRqKatZZWjtK2tzZ1kn6GiqMFuwMSsq2ahnpm2ons%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-root-england-first-test-india.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoe-root-england-first-test-india.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoe-root-england-first-test-india.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoe-root-england-first-test-india.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-root-england-first-test-india.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-root-england-first-test-india.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michelle-waterson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michelle-waterson.html>Michelle Waterson [2023 Update]: UFC, MMA &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./perry-noble.html>Fame | Perry Noble net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./perry-noble.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
