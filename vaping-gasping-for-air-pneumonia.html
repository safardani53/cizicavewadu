I just got hooked on them.</p><p>"When I was using disposable ones I went from buying them two to three times a week to every day.</p><p>"I was just smoking it anywhere and everywhere.

I just wanted to <a href=#>sleep</a>.</p><p>"When you can't breathe, you can't do anything.</p><p>"I got there and pretty much straight away I got put into a room because of how low my oxygen was.</p><p>"I had low blood pressure and my heart rate was through the roof - it went up to 130 beats per minute."</p><p>A normal <a href=#>heart rate</a> is between 60 and 100 beats per minute, according to the <a href=#>NHS</a>.</p><p>Jodie underwent a number of tests including an ECG and chest x-ray, which confirmed a diagnosis of vaping-related <a href=#>pneumonia</a>.</p><p>Jodie said: "I wasn't surprised but I thought this could end up being something a lot more serious if I don't stop it now.</p><p>"My mum said to me you really do have to quit, you might die.</p><p>"The doctors said it's obvious vaping is having an effect on my lungs.</p><p>"They didn't say whether there's permanent damage or anything but I've got to go back for another x-ray to check that."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What is vaping-related pneumonia?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Vaping-related lipoid pneumonia occurs when oily substances in e-cigarette vapour spark an inflammatory response in the lungs.</p><p>Symptoms include a chronic cough, shortness of breath and coughing up blood or blood-tinged mucus, according to <a href=# aria-label="John Hopkins Medicine (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Hopkins Medicine</a>.</p><p>Research published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) suggests that e-cigarettes may cause a potentially life-threatening lung inflammation.</p><p>The 2019 paper outlines a case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis – a condition in which the air sacs and airways in the lungs become severely inflamed – in a 16-year-old boy, who developed respiratory failure thought to be caused by the fluid in e-cigarettes.</p><p>Professor Andrew Bush, one of the research's co-authors and Royal Brompton’s consultant paediatric chest physician, said: "This case is very disturbing.</p><p>"We simply do not know the long-term consequences of vaping.</p><p>"We don't know what is in these devices and liquids, therefore, how can we possibly say they are safe to inhale into our lungs?</p><p>"They should be kept out of the hands of young people."</p><p>Jodie recalled being terrified her son would grow up without a mum.</p><p>"When they were considering admitting me, I thought, 'I'm never going to get out of this hospital; I just wanted to see my son one more time'," she said.</p><p>"It was scary. I don't want my son growing up without any parents.</p><p>"They just said, 'You've got to stop because it can get so much worse from here'."</p><p>The mum said she is "full of regret" over the impact both on her health and finances that vaping has caused.</p><p>Jodie said: "I'm now an asthmatic because of all this.

It's never you until it's too late," she added.</p><p>"This is definitely the wake-up call I needed. It's going to kill me sooner than anything else.</p><p>"Now I tell everyone to just quit - you don't need any other reason than your own health, save yourself.</p><p>"It's a waste, you're killing yourself."</p><p>Vaping is also said to cause a condition called <a href=#>popcorn lung</a> - a rare condition that causes the lungs’ small airways to become permanently narrowed, also known as bronchiolitis obliterans.</p><p><a href=#>Abby Flynn, 20</a>, who'd never smoked a cigarette in her life, was diagnosed with the condition after getting hooked on disposable vapes.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Doctors recently claimed that <a href=#>vaping can 'barbecue' your lungs</a>, due to their temperature being 'hotter than cigarette smoke'.</p><p>It comes as the UK government moots <a href=#>banning disposable</a> vapes to prevent children from becoming addicted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzgJFsaW1uaGTDorzIp55mn5Govaq6xmadqKpdlrazec%2BnnK6ln6O2ons%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvaping-gasping-for-air-pneumonia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvaping-gasping-for-air-pneumonia.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvaping-gasping-for-air-pneumonia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvaping-gasping-for-air-pneumonia.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvaping-gasping-for-air-pneumonia.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvaping-gasping-for-air-pneumonia.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./samuel-monroe-jr.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./samuel-monroe-jr.html>Samuel Monroe Jr</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./deshaun-watson.html>Fame | Deshaun Watson net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./deshaun-watson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
