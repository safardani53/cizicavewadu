When you tend to idealize things, you don’t have to deal with a lot of the tough realities.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aretha welcomed her first son, Clarence Franklin, when she was just a preteen. “I still wanted to get out and hang out with my friends,” she told Ebony in 1995 about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>becoming a mom so young</a>. “I wanted to be in two places at the same time. But my grandmother helped me a lot, and my sister and my cousin. They would babysit so I could get out occasionally.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few years later, she gave birth to her second son, Edward Franklin, at the age of 15. In 1961, when she was 19 years old, Aretha married music manager Ted White, and the pair welcomed a son, Ted White Jr., in 1964. Aretha and Ted divorced in 1969, and just one year later, the singer gave birth to her youngest son, Kecalf Cunningham, with her road manager Ken Cunningham.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While her children mainly stayed out of the spotlight, her four sons publicly grieved the loss of the "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>matriarch and rock of our family</a>" after the singer's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>death from pancreatic cancer</a> at the age of 76 on Aug. 16, 2018.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“In one of the darkest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our heart,” the family said in a statement. “We have lost the matriarch and rock of our family. The love she had for her children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and cousins knew no bounds.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Franklin was&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>without a will at the time of her death</a>,&nbsp;leaving her three sons Edward, Kecalf&nbsp;and Ted White Jr. embroiled in a legal battle regarding two handwritten documents — one from 2010 and one from 2014 — that were discovered in the late singer's home (according to the Associated Press, Clarence lives under legal guardianship and did not participate in the trial).<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While both documents called for the brothers to&nbsp;share income from their mother's music and copyrights, the AP reported that the 2014 document allowed Kecalf and her grandchildren to inherit Aretha's home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. A probate trial started in Michigan in July 2023, and a jury ultimately ruled in favor of the will from 2014. After the verdict was delivered, the Associated Press reported that Franklin's grandchildren stepped forward to hug Kecalf and Edward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m very, very happy. I just wanted my mother’s wishes to be adhered to,” said Kecalf, according to the Associated Press. “We just want to exhale right now. It’s been a long five years for my family, my children.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The will was eventually <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>carried out by a judge</a> in November 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on to learn all about Aretha Franklin’s four sons.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-clarence-franklin-68></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Clarence Franklin, 68</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Clarence Franklin (center), son of soul music icon Aretha Franklin.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bill Pugliano/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aretha welcomed her first son, Clarence, on Jan. 28, 1955, in Detroit, Michigan. She named him after her father, Clarence LaVaughn Franklin, who was a minister and civil rights activist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aretha was a preteen at the time and never publicly revealed who Clarence’s father was. She later confirmed in a handwritten will that Edward Jordan Sr. fathered her two older children but “never made any contribution to [their] welfare, future or past, monetarily, material, spiritual, etc."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aretha went back to school</a> after having Clarence,” the artist’s sister Erma said in Ritz’s 2014 biography Respect. “She was an excellent student who did well in all her classes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clarence went on to write several songs, some of which Aretha even sang and recorded herself. According to court papers obtained by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>, Clarence was diagnosed with an undisclosed mental illness and spent time in various assisted living facilities. He was not involved in the legal dispute between his three brothers, though both wills in question stated that the singer's estate must financially support him.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-edward-franklin-66></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Edward Franklin, 66</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Aretha Franklin, and Edward Franklin attend BET Honors in 2014.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Larry French/BET/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Jan. 22, 1957, Aretha welcomed her second son, Edward, in Detroit, Michigan. After giving birth to Edward, Aretha dropped out of school to focus on her music career, which meant Eddie spent a lot of time with his grandmother, Big Mama.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We were part of that generation of young female singers who definitely sacrificed time with our kids to attend to our careers. We did so knowingly,” Arthea's oldest sister said in Respect. “We also did so with heavy guilt.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eddie followed his mother's footsteps in the music industry, working as a gospel singer and even recording a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>cover of “This Christmas”</a> with his mom. “I’ve worked with her before ... we knocked the song out in two or three takes,” he said of the experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2010, Eddie was badly beaten in an attack by three men at a Detroit gas station and required surgery to wire his jaw shut.&nbsp;Neither he nor his mother spoke out about the attack, though Aretha did confirm the attack in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>statement to Billboard</a> while clarifying some misinformation about the situation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Aretha died, Eddie <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>gave a touching performance</a> of Marvin Gaye’s “Mercy Mercy Me” as a tribute to her at her funeral.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-teddy-richards-59></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Teddy Richards, 59</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Aretha Franklin's son, Teddy Richards, performing.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Derek Storm/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1961, Aretha married Ted White at age 19, and he quickly began managing her. They welcomed son Ted White Jr. — who goes by Teddy Richards professionally — in February 1964 in Detroit. Just a few years later, however, Aretha divorced Ted amid reports of domestic abuse (according to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>1968 TIME story</a>, he "roughed her up" more than once).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While most of Aretha’s children lived together with her and her family in Detroit, Teddy grew up mostly under the care of his father. Still, he was close with his mom and spent decades playing backup guitar in her band. Despite his mom's support, Teddy told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the Detroit Free Press</a> in 2021 that his dad was more reluctant about him entering the music business.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“What he emphasized in our home was not showbiz but education,” Teddy said of his father. “He was about staying as far as away from it as possible. He knew the pratfalls, the things most people don’t think about, in the music business. He wanted to put me on a different track.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless, Teddy broke out to become a singer-songwriter on his own and has performed with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nelly Furtado</a>, Joe Cocker, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Seal</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Lenny Kravitz</a> and INXS and released several albums of his work.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've evolved from a self-taught guitarist into a producer, engineer and accomplished tunesmith; I truly love music and enjoy the journey that it's taken me on," Teddy wrote in his bio while announcing his third album, Solitaire. He also describes himself as “Southwest Florida’s #1 solo entertainer” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>on his website</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While speaking to the Detroit Free Press in 2021, Teddy opened up about the difficulty he faced trying to create his own identity as a musician while being the son of one of the most famous singers of all time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I learned quite early, especially when dealing with journalists or people tied to the industry, it was very easy to be exploited as ‘the son of Aretha,’ ” he said. “If you’re trying to do something in your own name, making your own way in the world, it’s going to be impossible if that’s how people know you. It would allow them to ignore your accomplishments.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the musician was dedicated to forging his own path.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“To some folks, it might look like, ‘He was denying his own mother.’ It’s not that at all,” Teddy said. “I love both my parents dearly.

His name is a combination of his mom’s initials — A.L.F — and his father Ken E. Cunningham’s. Ken was Aretha’s road manager at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kecalf had a career as a gospel rapper and performed on stage with his mom several times. He's also the father of several children who, like their famous grandmother, are also singer-songwriters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kecalf's daughter Grace even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>auditioned for American Idol</a>; her audition aired during a February 2022 episode. "I don't think I could fully grasp the fact that [my grandmother] was known worldwide," she said at the time. "Because to me, she was always grandma ... I was really close to my grandma. I got to see her all the time. I got to travel with her a lot."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following Aretha's death, Kecalf <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spoke out passionately against</a> the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jennifer Hudson</a>-led biopic Respect released in 2021. In a lengthy Facebook post, he wrote, “How can you make a movie about a person and not talk to the person’s [sic] sons or grandchildren about important information? How can you put a person’s [sic] family (image) in a book and not ask permission?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kecalf also became involved in a fight over his late mother's estate, claiming that his mother's 2014 will stated that she wanted him to serve as the estate’s representative.
