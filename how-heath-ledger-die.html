His feet were on the ground and he was the least neurotic person I've ever met."</p><p>It's more likely Heath's insomnia led him to self-medicate, a theory that has been backed up by Michelle Williams and <a href=#>Christopher Plummer</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2488459.main_image.jpg><h2>What was Heath like as an actor?</h2><p>Often being compared to James Dean, Heath was known for taking roles that were "on the edge" and that challenged him, as nothing else piqued his interest.</p><p>Explaining why he took on a variety of characters rather than playing romantic heroes, he said: "I feel like I'm wasting my time if I repeat myself."</p><p>Despite being a heartthrob, his real interest lay in becoming a director himself, and the visionary was always pointing cameras at things.</p><p>In 2007, he told a reporter: "There are so many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note."</p><p>Christopher Nolan said of working with the actor on The Dark Knight:&nbsp;"I've never felt as old as I did watching Heath explore his talents."</p><h2></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1788297.main_image.jpg><h2>Was&nbsp;Heath's death linked to his Joker role?</h2><p>Since Heath's part as the Joker in The Dark Knight was the last film role he completed — and his darkest by far — fans have rather inevitably linked it to his tragic death.</p><p>But according to the family member he was closest to, there is no truth in the rumour Heath grew depressed or manic as a result of becoming the villain.</p><p>At a Q&A at the I Am Heath Ledger premiere, his older sister Kate said: "I was really shocked&nbsp;because that was him having fun.</p><p>"Every report was coming out that he was depressed and that [the role] was taking this toll on him, and we're going, honestly, it was the absolute opposite. It couldn't be more wrong.</p><p>"He had an amazing sense of humour, and I guess maybe only his family and friends knew that, but he was having fun. He wasn't depressed about the Joker!”</p><p>The maker of the documentary, Matt Amato, added: "I hope it's an antidote to a lot of the gossip that exists in the world.</p><p>"There are some really terrible things about Heath out there."</p><p>In the "immaculately clean"&nbsp;apartment where Heath died, investigators found&nbsp;comic books, research on clowns and the Joker's origins, small clown statues and recordings of the actor's Joker voice experiments.</p><p>He also wrote a journal as the Joker in the run-up to the movie shoot, which ominously ended with the words "bye bye".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000003694007.jpg><h2>Was Heath Ledger married and did he have children?</h2><p>Heath had a daughter with American actress Michelle Williams in 2005, called Matilda Rose.</p><p>Michelle and Heath split in 2007 and all Heath's fortune, around £13million, was left to Matilda in its entirety.</p><p>Through his life, Heath also had relationships with Naomi Watts, Lisa Zane, Heather Graham and, close to his death, supermodel Gemma Ward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000285576740.jpg><h2>Did Heath have plans beyond 2008?</h2><p>Before his death, the former chess champion was planning to direct a feature film&nbsp;called The Queen's Gambit, based on a 1983 novel.</p><p>The book, by Walter Tevis, has now been adapted into a hit Netflix series by Scott Frank and Allan Shiach.</p><p>Heath wanted to segue into film directing, having learned from filmmakers like Nolan, Gilliam, Marc Forster, Ang Lee and Catherine Hardwicke.</p><p>No doubt Heath would have been invited back to play the Joker, who he described as&nbsp;"psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy", in more movies.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">latest film news</h2></p><p>Despite his tragic death, Heath's enduring&nbsp;impact on cinema and the art of performance is beyond question.</p><p>He said in 2006: "You know when you see the preachers down South? And they grab a believer and they go, 'Bwoom! I touch you with the hand of God!' And they believe so strongly, they're on the ground shaking and spitting... Now, I don't believe in Jesus, but I believe in my performance.</p><p>"And if you can understand that the power of belief is one of the great tools of our time and that a lot of acting comes from it, you can do anything."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>The Dark Knight - New Trailer</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqZGyDdoOYaJ%2Bor12dsqLAx2ajnpyXmr9usMieZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-heath-ledger-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-heath-ledger-die.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-heath-ledger-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-heath-ledger-die.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-heath-ledger-die.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-heath-ledger-die.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./peter-scanavino-wife-kids-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./peter-scanavino-wife-kids-html.html>Law &amp;amp; Order Star Peter Scanavino Leads a Private Life with His Wife and Kids</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-good-doctor-claire-stays-guatemala-new-job-season-4-finale.html>Claire Stays In Guatemala &amp;amp; Gets New Job In Finale Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-good-doctor-claire-stays-guatemala-new-job-season-4-finale.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
