I wasn’t invited," Ellen quipped.</p><p>"Actually, no, that’s not the truth, Ellen,” Dakota then announced to the audience's delight.</p><p>The actress said she invited the host after she gave her a hard time about&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not being invited</a>&nbsp;last year.</p><p>“Last time I was on the show, last year, you gave me a bunch of s**t about not inviting you, but I didn’t even know you wanted to be invited,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4c386d10-ae88-4733-9770-31f4c3e8ce18.jpg><p>For once, Ellen appeared to be lost for words on her own show:&nbsp;“Well, who wouldn’t want to be invited to a party?” she asked.</p><p>“Well, I didn’t even know you liked me,” Johnson replied, to the presenter's horror.</p><p>“Of course I like you. You knew I liked you," Ellen then said, before an incredibly awkward silence.</p><p>The clip sparked a wave of comments from viewers on YouTube, with one writing: "This interview is so passive aggressive," while another added: "The beginning of the end for Ellen. Dakota is a trailblazer."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000544826101.jpg><p>Let's wait and see if she's invited next year.</p><h2>Jodie Comer's accents come under fire</h2><p>Killing Eve star Jodie Comer may have earned major credit for her incredible accents here in the UK - but Ellen ended up leaving the actress very red-faced when she questioned her over them on the show last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0ebcecb1-a0f7-4473-a2d9-e41f5b5f4cc2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7066a55b-164e-4f86-8006-9349d80f813f.jpg><p>Jodie's character, assassin Villanelle, is known for adopting different accents as she takes on different personas for each murder - but it wasn't this character that Ellen picked out.</p><p>Instead, she began by praising her for her “American accent” as Kate Parks on Doctor Foster.</p><p>Clearly very embarrassed, Jodie quickly replied: “No she was British…”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9b73711c-a7fb-48b5-a676-ee560d747f2e.jpg><p>As Ellen appeared shocked by the mistake, Jodie added: “Oh I didn’t do a good job there. She was British, she was from London.”</p><p>Luckily she was able to laugh off the incident shortly afterwards - but not all fans were able to let it go so quickly.</p><p>One even wrote on Twitter shortly after: "It didn't sound as though @TheEllenShow knew the first thing about Jodie or either show she mentioned. "<br></p><h2>Taylor Swift almost 'reduced to tears'</h2><p>One of the most difficult interviews to watch came in 2012, when Ellen repeatedly quizzed Taylor Swift about her exes - despite the singer expressing how uncomfortable she felt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600171313.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/d2084cd8-8276-4702-b632-9ed7b91a3cd4.jpg><p>The segment began with Ellen insisting Taylor had dated Zac Efron - despite her point blank denying it.</p><p>It then developed from there, as a slideshow of the men Taylor has previously been linked was played behind her.</p><p>When asked to buzz the one she'd recently penned a song about, Taylor appeared completely mortified and refused, saying: "I don't want to, I don't want to, please stop."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/248fc962-33a2-4cc7-8bc4-044673617782.jpg><p>Appearing close to tears, she then put her head in her hands and said: "Every time I come up here you make me feel so bad about myself by putting a different dude up there on the screen and it really makes me question what I stand for as a human being."</p><p>The pair have remained firm friends in the years since all the same - but not before fans claimed the cruel trick was "torture" for the singer.<br></p><h2>Hasan Minhaj calls host out over mispronunciation of name</h2><p>Ellen's interview with comedian Hasan Minhaj earlier last year sparked a major debate when he was forced to call the host out for mispronouncing his name.</p><p>When Ellen first asked if she was saying it correctly, Hasan immediately said "no" - to which she bizarrely attempted to argue it, and said "yes".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/61f86a44-dfcc-4862-aeca-310efc0d422c.jpg><p>Stopping the discussion, Hasan chose the opportunity to talk through the many years he'd been forced to deal with people saying his name wrong - before teaching Ellen exactly how to say it.</p><p>Hasan later spoke out about the appearance, and revealed he chose to call Ellen out after seeing his mum in the audience at the time.</p><p>“I looked in the audience... and [my mum] kind of cringed,” he said on an episode of his Netflix show, Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj. “And I was like, ‘Dude, what am I doing?’ I have a show with my f***ing name on it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7e88dd66-18b3-4f88-af30-78b58f040856.jpg><p>He added: "So I was like, ‘All right, Ellen, let’s just do this right now'. Because we can pronounce Timothée Chalamet, so we’re going to do this right now."</p><p>After watching the clip on YouTube, one viewer commented: "It's looks like Hasan is interviewing Ellen.. TheHasanShow." Meanwhile another added: "Basically, HM: 'That's not my name' Ellen: 'It is!' Erm..."</p><h2>Celine Dion forced to defend own son's hair</h2><p>If there's one thing you don't do, it's criticise a guest's child's appearance - but Ellen went there when she invited Celine Dion on her show in 2007.</p><p>Pulling up a photo of the singer's child on screen, Ellen said to her: "Look at him. He is beautiful but look at his hair. When are you going to cut that hair?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f6b7da78-1190-488a-8f0d-3062bbf3ba86.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/df529b78-8b5b-4505-9a37-db01ea9d6aea.jpg><p>Defending it, Celine asked if the host had a "problem" with it, before adding: "Some people shave the head of their children, and people say, 'Oh, isn't that terrible?'</p><p>"Well, I don't even cut my son's hair and they say, 'Oh my god, when is she going to cut her son's hair?' You know? Whatever I will do, I won't please everyone."</p><p>She added: "When he's ready, I'll cut it."</p><p>It prompted some angry comments from viewers on YouTube, with some branding Ellen's comments "rude" while another added: "Celine Dion played that off so well lol. Ellen was EMBARRASSED."</p><h2>Mariah Carey's tense 'pregnancy reveal'</h2><p>In yet another tense moment, Ellen came under fire when she repeatedly attempted to persuade Mariah Carey to confirm she was pregnant on air in 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/84662534-6ea4-42e7-bdb6-4c0e983749a2.jpg><p>With rumours circulating about the news at the time, Ellen suggested it was time Mariah confirmed it once and for all.</p><p>While the host appeared to let it go when Mariah ignored the question, she instead reached for two champagne glasses and said: "Let’s toast to you not being pregnant if you’re not pregnant."</p><p>Mariah then responded: "I can't believe you did this to me, Ellen. This is peer pressure."</p><p>Eventually holding the glass up, Mariah simply said it was "too early" for a drink, which got cheers from the audience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f6295f9a-3574-4864-b402-f5433c0c5062.jpg><p>Tragically, weeks later Mariah went on to have a miscarriage.</p><p>The interview has since come under fire all over again, with some fans accusing Ellen of "forcing" Mariah to confirm her pregnancy before she was ready.</p><h2>Nicole Kidman called out on her clap</h2><p>While some interviews are downright mortifying, others are hilariously cringeworthy.</p><p>Nicole Kidman left fans in hysterics when she began clapping in a very bizarre way at the Oscars in 2017, with some even comparing it to a "seal" - so the last thing she needed was to have it shown in front of Ellen's entire audience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9d72faa1-9f36-49fa-9437-2045a3132f51.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4a7d305d-5718-410c-b1ea-70ee979f85a3.jpg><p>But that's exactly what happened months later - and the actress appeared horrified throughout.</p><p>“You got a lot of attention for the way you were clapping [at the Oscars],” Ellen said, to which Nicole replied: “Ellen!”</p><p>When the host then asked:&nbsp;“Did you know ahead of time that you clapped in a different way?” Nicole insisted: “I don't clap like that! I do not clap like that! That is a weird lens!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/43f8552f-643e-4871-973a-6f8a67350cdd.jpg><p>Keen to keep the discussion going, Ellen added: “The lens didn't do it to anybody else's fingers! How can you make any noise like that? You're not even really clapping.”</p><p>Nicole then finally explained: "You borrow these expensive jewels, and I'm like, ‘I must not damage these diamonds! Cause I have to give them back at midnight!' And so I'm like, clapping.”</p><p>Who doesn't want to relive one of their most embarrassing moments after all?<br></p><h2>Audience member singled out for stealing</h2><p>However, possibly the most embarrassing moment came when Ellen singled out a member of her audience for stealing in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/55755962-913b-4f31-81ce-3bbc0cb2a8d4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/e46195e6-20b4-418f-81a6-9e7b49f76095.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/72547b12-6610-4e3d-9860-89730236acd1-1.jpg><p>The host had invited her guests to pick up one item each from the gift shop - without telling them she'd set up hidden cameras to see what each of them took.</p><p>Unbeknownst to one woman, she was filmed taking several items away - and Ellen called her out on it on air shortly after.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Clearly extremely embarrassed to have been caught, she told the host that she was picking up souvenirs for her sister who couldn't come along - but Ellen refused to let it go.</p><p>She eventually asked the woman to come on stage and step into 'jail', by sitting on a big steel chair in front of the entire audience.</p><p>She likely wanted it to sink into the floor.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Neil Breen claims Ellen DeGeneres' staff 'ordered him not to look at or speak to' host as talk show investigated for 'toxic' culture</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpYmqFdIWTaJylpJWjeqWxxp6lnqqVqHquu9KtZJqvm6yus7CMoqWtnaKrtqbD0mabmqOfqa5uts6hpaynnmQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fellen-degeneres-most-awkward-interviews-dakota-johnson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fellen-degeneres-most-awkward-interviews-dakota-johnson.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fellen-degeneres-most-awkward-interviews-dakota-johnson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fellen-degeneres-most-awkward-interviews-dakota-johnson.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fellen-degeneres-most-awkward-interviews-dakota-johnson.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fellen-degeneres-most-awkward-interviews-dakota-johnson.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./faith-hill-filing-for-divorce-after-tim-mcgraws-second-family-ex.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./faith-hill-filing-for-divorce-after-tim-mcgraws-second-family-ex.html>Filing For Divorce After Tim McGraw's &amp;quot;Second Family&amp;quot; Exposed?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alec-baldwin-apologizes-for-twitter-rant-denies-homophobia.html>Alec Baldwin Apologizes for Twitter Rant, Denies Homophobia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alec-baldwin-apologizes-for-twitter-rant-denies-homophobia.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
