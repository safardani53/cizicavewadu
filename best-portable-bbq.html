Enter the portable BBQ.</p><p>Compact portable barbecues are more affordable, great for smaller spaces, and they're ideal for taking on adventures and staycations.</p><p>And, unlike single-use disposable BBQs that damage the grass and are actually tricky to get rid of sustainably, portable BBQs are more economical.</p><p>Not sure which portable BBQ to go for? Don't sweat it. Here, we've explained what to look for when choosing the best portable BBQ for you.</p><h2>Best portable BBQs at a glance:</h2><h2>We tested: Kamado Joe Jr<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kamado-Joe-Junior.jpg></h2><ul><li><strong>Kamado Joe Jr, £436.31 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>For a portable barbecue, the Kamado Joe Jr is a little pricey. But, that is partly because this versatile barbecue is big enough to use as your regular at-home BBQ and compact enough to take on the road with you as well. So, you'll get a lot of use out of this guy.</p><p>The egg-style barbecue is made almost entirely from ceramic, which keeps the heat and moisture in. This means that you can use it to grill, bake, roast and smoke - something that you’d normally need a much bigger barbecue for.</p><p>Thanks to a vent at the top and at the bottom of the barbecue, it’s easy to control the temperature inside, which can go all the way up to 400C for searing, or down to 100C for smoking.</p><p>It might be small but it's pretty hefty in weight, coming in at 31kg. This is just about portable but you’ll definitely need someone to give you a hand with it. With that in mind, this one is probably better suited for longer camping trips than a casual picnic somewhere.</p><p>Portability aside, we were very impressed with the results we got from the Kamado Joe Jr.</p><p>Everything had that smokey barbecue taste you get from charcoal but it doesn’t overwhelm any herbs or spices you use. Plus, the meat is super moist, almost like it’s been steamed.</p><p>Another downside is the hidden cost of the lump wood charcoal you need to fire this BBQ up. Lumpwood charcoal can be a bit more expensive than briquettes, and you need to use it every time.</p><p>But, if you manage the fire well (Kamado Joe gives you plenty of tips for this), you’ll actually use less charcoal than on a regular barbecue.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: ‎19.8 x 20.8 x 27 cm; <strong>Weight</strong>: 31kg; <strong>Fuel source:</strong> Lumpwood charcoal</p><h2>We tested: Everdure by Heston Blumenthal Cube</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUBEGGB-CUBE-BBQ-Charcoal-HBCUBEOGB-CUBE-BBQ-Orange-Lifestyle.jpg><ul><li><strong>Everdure by Heston Blumenthal Cube, £<span class=a-price-whole>199<span class=a-price-decimal>.</span></span><span class=a-price-fraction>00</span> from John Lewis </strong><strong>- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The Everdure by Heston Blumenthal Cube is one of the most design-centric portable charcoal barbecues around. By that, we mean that it packs a lot of features into a small frame (23cm x 42cm x 35cm).</p><p>The lid is a shallow bamboo tray, so it cleverly doubles up as a chopping board. The tray slots into a deeper food-grade plastic tray that can be used to store everything from cutlery to your ingredients. Handy, right?</p><p>Both of these components then nest into the firebox and can be secured into place using clips, so there’s no worrying about things falling out when you’re transporting it.</p><p>The firebox itself, which is the grill component, has cool-touch handles on two sides so you don't burn yourself. Even though the sleek cube shape of this BBQ means it doesn't have legs, it can still be used on the ground or on a wooden bench because it is slightly raised. And, the firebox is insulated all the way around with vents to help cool the exterior. However, you shouldn’t put it on anything that will warp or might otherwise be damaged by the heat, so it's safest to avoid plastics and fabrics.</p><p>Inside the firebox, you have a top grill for the food, a lower grill for your fuel and a tray to catch the ash.</p><p>It may be small in size, but the cooking surface is big enough for six burgers so you can cook for a small family in one go.</p><p>We like the portability of this BBQ, but because of its size, we found it a bit harder to get the charcoal going and would recommend having a chimney starter to hand.</p><p>It also concentrated the heat more than our usual barbecue, which meant we had to be more careful so as to avoid burning the food.</p><p>But for a picnic or camping trip, we think this is a seriously stylish option to go for.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: ‎23 x 42.5 x 34.7cm; <strong>Weight</strong>: 7kg; <strong>Fuel source:</strong> Charcoal</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><h2>We tested: Cuisinart entertaining grill</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PL60U-Image-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Cuisinart entertaining grill, £250 from Harrods - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>You’ll need a power source close by to use the Cuisinart entertaining grill, but we think it’s ideal for caravan trips, or even indoor/outdoor use at home.</p><p>The whole thing is pretty hefty at 16cm x 50cm x 42.5cm, although it's not too heavy to lift for one person.</p><p>The electric grill comes with a detachable large, flat, non-stick cooking surface that you can clean in the dishwasher. However, doing it by hand will help maintain the non-stick coating.</p><p>On the front, there are two heat controls that go up to 260 degrees so you can vary the temperature on either side of the grill according to what you’re cooking.</p><p>The grill can be used for everything from cooking eggs and bacon for breakfast, burgers and sausages for lunch, to rustling up teppanyaki-style dinners.</p><p>We tried a few recipes on the grill and found it really easy to work with and the results were great.</p><p>There’s a handy hole near the base where excess oil can be drained away into a removable tray, or you can plug it to keep any cooking juices or sauces on the grill.</p><p>It's pretty time efficient, too. You’ll need to wait at least five minutes for the grill to come up to temperature, but that’s nothing compared to how long it takes for a charcoal grill to be ready.</p><p>You’ll also need to have a plastic or wooden flat turner as otherwise, you’ll find it hard to lift the food off the grill.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: ‎16 cm x 50 cm x 42.5cm; <strong>Weight</strong>: 15kg; <strong>Fuel source:</strong> Electric</p><h2>Texas 43cm Kettle Charcoal BBQ</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/14005792-2095014611473229.jpg><ul><li><strong>Texas 43cm Kettle Charcoal BBQ, £40 (saving £10) from Homebase - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If you're looking for something budget-friendly that still comes with a stand and wheels, you can't do much better than this Texas BBQ, which is currently on sale at Homebase.</p><p>It's easy to assemble, and thanks to its two wheels, it's great for taking camping, caravanning, or just moving it to find the sunniest spot of your garden.</p><p>Although it's affordable, it's still high quality; it's constructed from steel, with a black porcelain enamelled steel lid and fire bowl. Unlike many portable BBQs, it also comes with a base shelf for storing tools and sauces, and the cooking area is big enough to cater for five or six people.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: ‎82 x 52 x 45cm; <strong>Fuel source:</strong> Charcoal</p><h2>Weber Go-Anywhere portable charcoal BBQ</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/61sR4PiAXaL._AC_SL1000_.jpg><ul><li><strong>Weber Go-Anywhere portable BBQ, £99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Fans of Weber’s barbecues will love the smaller Go-Anywhere version, which — thanks to a cooking area of 41cm x 25cm — is perfect for small groups or for taking on trips away.</p><p>It measures 44cm x 42cm x 27cm, and weighs in at 6.5kg, making it easy to pop into the back of the car and lug around with you.</p><p>There’s some self-assembly required though, and it has folding legs and a lid that you need to lock into place.</p><p>Compared to the other BBQs on this list, you'll notice it's on the pricier side. But, the gadget does come with a 10-year guarantee.</p><p>This one on Amazon is a charcoal version but you can also get a portable gas one directly from Weber.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: ‎55 x 28 x 41.5cm; <strong>Weight</strong>: 6.1kg; <strong>Fuel source:</strong> Charcoal</p><h2>Valiant FIR551 folding portable picnic and camping barbecue</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/81E2rLtZaL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><ul><li><strong>Valiant portable barbecue, £44.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This super portable barbecue weighs in at 3.3kg, so it’s lightweight enough for a day out or trip away.</p><p>The whole thing folds down into a lockable suitcase, measuring just 40cm x 10cm x 28.5cm. This means it is compact enough to fit into a backpack or suitcase.</p><p>The cooking surface is fairly small though, measuring 32cm x 23cm, so it’s not one for big groups unless you don’t mind waiting. But, for a small group (up to six people, we think) or a romantic evening with your other half, it's perfect.</p><p>Thanks to the legs, you can use this portable BBQ on decking or grass without any risk of scorching.</p><p>Even though it has a foldaway design and isn't designed to be taken apart and stuck in the dishwasher, it's still very easy to clean by hand.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: ‎15.7 x 3.9 x 11.2cm; <strong>Weight</strong>: 3.3kg; <strong>Fuel source: </strong>Charcoal</p><h2>Argos Home charcoal portable round BBQ</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3451656_R_Z001A_UC1256008.jpg><ul><li><strong>Argos Home charcoal portable round BBQ, £20 from Argos - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>For a great budget-friendly option, try this portable BBQ from Argos Home, which weighs just 2kg (one of the lightest options you'll find).</p><p>It's certainly petite, measuring just 29cm x 36cm x 36.5cm and having a cooking area of 23cm x 34cm. This means it's the definition of portable, but it's probably not great if you're cooking for a large, hungry group. This one is best for smaller groups of around four people or less.</p><p>The base doesn’t fold in so it’s a bit bulkier than some of the other models, but it does have the benefit of being more sturdy.</p><p>The stand fits into the base and you can clip the lid on to avoid spillage when transporting after use.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: ‎29cm x 36cm x 36.5cm; <strong>Weight</strong>: 2kg; <strong>Fuel source: </strong>Charcoal</p><h2>Char-Broil Grill2Go X200 portable gas BBQ</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/213938_1_1-e1623946450139.jpg><ul><li><strong>Char-Broil Grill2Go portable BBQ, £143 from Appliances Direct - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Char-Broil’s Grill2Go X200 portable gas BBQ is a bigger machine and can easily be used at home if you’re only cooking for a couple of people.</p><p>It measures 34.5cm x 60.2cm x 40cm so it's fairly big, but still small enough to be considered portable.</p><p>The legs are super sturdy while the lid, complete with a temperature gauge, locks into place for when you want to take it out.</p><p>You’ll need to get a portable propane gas cartridge to use it on the go - or you can also use it with a standard gas tank if you get an adaptor for it.</p><p>In terms of its actual cooking ability, this machine promises 100% even heat distribution and uses TRU-Infrared Cooking Technology to give up to 50 per cent juicer food while using up to 30 per cent less gas.

Its unique design allows the lid to open flat, which means you can instantly double your cooking space by using the lid as a second grill — something that most portable BBQs do not offer. So, if you want to travel light but have a lot of mouths to feed, this is the BBQ for you.</p><p>Both grill spaces have adjustable vents so you can effectively control the heat as you cook.</p><p>Once you’re done, the lid just clips back into place and you can carry it using the wooden handle that’s attached to the lid.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 26 x 39 x 25.8cm; <strong>Weight</strong>: 2.9kg; <strong>Fuel source: </strong>Charcoal</p><h2>LotusGrill standard portable smokeless charcoal barbecue</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/LotusGrill-standard-portable-smokeless-charcoal-barbecue.jpg><ul><li><strong>LotusGrill portable charcoal barbecue, £165 from John Lewis - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>At just 4kg, this charcoal barbecue is very light.

It's already super compact but comes with a useful storage bag, a lid with a hinge for easy handling, and a bottom bag to make it even more comfortable to carry around on your adventures.</p><p>Although it seems to be footless, it's not. This BBQ has tiny silicone feet so, whether you're using it on the ground or a surface, it is slightly raised and won't cause any damage.</p><p>Worried about cleaning it? Don't be.

The cheapest you'll find one for is around £20 (like the Argos one in this article), but you could splurge and go for a more expensive travel BBQ.</p><p>The most luxurious portable BBQ you'll find is probably the Kamado Joe at over £500. Anything more than that is probably a garden BBQ, not a portable one.</p><h2>How to use a portable BBQ</h2><p>Portable barbecues work in much the same way as regular barbecues, except they are much smaller and can be packed away for easy carrying or storage.</p><p>Shopping for one is pretty straightforward and you don't need to be an expert, but there are a couple of things to consider when choosing one.</p><p>The cooking surface size can vary a lot so always check the measurements when picking the best portable BBQ for you (we've done this part for you).</p><p>Another thing to think about is the legs. Some portable barbecues have legs or stands that fold in for storage. These should be sturdy enough to lift the barbecue off the ground without wobbling if it gets a bit windy, so look for models that have something to secure the legs in position.</p><p>Like all barbecues, portable ones need a flat surface, ideally in a sheltered position.</p><p>But because they’re much closer to the ground, you should look for surfaces that won’t burn or suffer from heat damage. Dry grass and anything plastic, for example, should be avoided at all costs.</p><p>For charcoal options, you might also want to get a chimney lighter as it can be harder to get a fire started in a smaller space.</p><p>Finally, remember to allow your BBQ to fully cool before you try to pack it away after you’ve finished using it.</p><p>Now you've understood all of that,&nbsp; here are some of the best portable barbecues around.</p><h2>What is the best portable BBQ</h2><p>Of the portable barbecues we’ve tested, we would say the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kamado Joe Jr</a> was hands down our favourite.</p><p>That said, it’s not the most portable option around.</p><p>If you’re looking for a lightweight option that’s built to last, try the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Everdure Cube</a>.</p><h2>How to light a portable BBQ</h2><p>Portable barbecues don’t give you that much space to build a mound so the easiest way to light your charcoal is to get a chimney starter.</p><p>That way you just have to light some balls of newspapers under your coals, let them catch and then tip into your firebox.</p><p>If you have a bigger model with more room, build a mound with your charcoal in the centre, making sure there’s plenty of space in between your briquettes or logs to allow air through.</p><p>Then in the bigger gaps, tuck in one or two pieces of natural fire starter and light these.</p><p>As they burn, the charcoal around it should catch.</p><p>When your charcoal starts turning grey from the ash, you’re ready to cook - just distribute the coals around the firebox first.</p><p>Of course, if you have a gas barbecue, it should be as easy as turning on the gas and then lighting it with a match but do double check the instructions that come with your machine as some models have an electric lighter.</p><h2>How to make a portable BBQ</h2><p>If you don’t fancy buying a portable barbecue, you can make one yourself quite cheaply.</p><p>It can be as simple as putting an oven grill over an old baking tray that’s at least a couple of inches deep.</p><p>However, double check the material your oven tray is made from first as some will warp or even melt at relatively low temperatures.<br>Carbon steel or cast iron is generally good but aluminium should be avoided.</p><p>Be aware though that because there’s no insulation around the tray, the ground beneath it can get extremely hot so make sure you’re not barbecuing over anything that can be scorched by fire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmptYm6Dd4SSaJmeq6RivbC%2B05qZpZ1dl6%2Byew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-portable-bbq.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-portable-bbq.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-portable-bbq.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-portable-bbq.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-portable-bbq.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-portable-bbq.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./all-about-raven-symone-brother-blaize-pearman-8414369.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./all-about-raven-symone-brother-blaize-pearman-8414369.html>All About Raven-Symons Late Brother, Blaize Pearman</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./robert-rockwell.html>Robert Rockwell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./robert-rockwell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
