On the trip they posted pictures of themselves beekeeping in matching outfits.</p><p>Millie gushed on Instagram: “I love adventures with you.”</p><p>She was just nine when she got her first telly role in 2013, then at 12 she landed the part of telepathic Eleven alongside Winona Ryder in Netflix sci-fi blockbuster Stranger Things.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON CELEBRITY DATING">READ MORE ON CELEBRITY DATING</h2><h2>Very empowering</h2><p>The drama has made a superstar of Millie, with its most recent fourth series being watched more than a billion times in a month.</p><p>Since finding fame she has launched a production company and a make-up range, and already has an estimated net worth of £11.6million.</p><p>An insider told The Sun: “She might be young but you’ve got to remember she has been working for almost a decade. That’s longer than some 30-year-olds.</p><p>“Many people have accused her of living well beyond her years — but that’s not always a bad thing, is it?</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>“Jake is no stranger to the fame game either and they both have their heads on their shoulders.</p><p>“They are young, in love, so why not be happy?”</p><p>Yet recently Millie saw the darker side of fame when a TikTok influencer claimed he had “groomed” her when she was just 16.</p><p>In a livestream last summer, Hunter “Echo” Ecimovic told fans he had lived with Millie at her parents’ place for eight months.</p><p>Her legal team confirmed they were taking action against him, saying: “Mr Ecimovic’s remarks on social media are not only dishonest but also are irresponsible, offensive and hateful.</p><p>“Instead of engaging in a public discourse with him through the press or on social media, we are taking action to ensure that he stops this behaviour once and for all.”</p><p>In a magazine interview this year, Millie said: “When you get publicly humiliated this way, I felt so out of control and powerless. Walking away and knowing that I’m worth everything and this person didn’t take anything from me, it felt very empowering.”</p><p>Previously, concerns were raised when aged just 14 Millie became close friends with Canadian rapper <a href=#>Drake</a> — 18 years her senior.</p><p>She told an interviewer: “I love him. He’s honestly a great friend and a great role model.</p><p>“You know we text. We just texted each other the other day and he was like, ‘I miss you so much’, and I was like, ‘I miss you more’.”</p><p>The interview prompted concerns on social media about how appropriate the friendship was.</p><p>A fan tweeted: “I have a niece around Millie’s age. if she came over here talkin about a 31 year old man texting her... I’d HIT THE ROOF.”</p><p>The actress hit back: “Why u gotta make a lovely friendship ur headline? U guys are weird.”</p><p>On her 16th birthday Millie spoke up about being sexualised as a child in <a href=#>Hollywood</a>. She wrote on her Instagram: “The last few years haven’t been easy, I’ll admit that.</p><p>“There are moments I get frustrated from the inaccuracy, inappropriate comments, sexualisation and un-necessary insults that ultimately have resulted in pain and insecurity for me. But not ever will I be defeated.</p><p>“I’ll continue doing what I love and spreading the message in order to make change.”</p><p>And this year she said X-rated comments had become more intense since she turned 18.</p><p>She added: “It’s just a very good representation of what’s going on in the world and how young girls are sexualised. And so I have been dealing with that, but also have been dealing with that for forever.”</p><p>And it appears her tightly-knit gang of co-stars have been watching her back. <a href=#>David Harbour</a>, who plays police chief Jim Hopper, her character’s adoptive father, said he felt a duty to protect her.</p><p>The actor, who is married to singer <a href=#>Lily Allen</a>, said: “I have a real protective feeling for her. I have a real, like, worry.</p><p>“I worry about her and the fame and all that she has to struggle with. I’ve just always felt this kind of deep fatherly affection for her.”</p><p>And Millie’s parents Kelly and Robert have been involved in her career, launching production company PCMA with her in 2020.</p><p>Millie was born in Marbella shortly after her parents moved to the Spanish resort. When she was four the family moved back to the UK, to <a href=#>Bournemouth</a> — but not for long.</p><p>When she turned eight they moved to Orlando, <a href=#>Florida</a>, to launch a tooth-whitening business.</p><p>There, Millie says she taught herself to speak with an American accent by watching <a href=#>Miley Cyrus’s</a> Disney show Hannah Montana.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/millie-bobby-brown-sparks-engagement-rumours-flashes-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/millie-bobby-brown-sparks-engagement-rumours-flashes-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/plot-when-young-boy-disappears-mother-confront.jpg><h2>American twang</h2><p>But the family almost went broke while trying to make their daughter famous.</p><p>An agent convinced them to move to <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> to give stage school pupil Millie a chance at stardom.</p><p>She had middlingly successful roles in US TV fantasy drama Once Upon A Time In Wonderland and BBC America’s Intruders.</p><p>But the ambitious young actress failed to get her big break. Just before she hit the big time with Netflix, the near-bankrupt family moved back to the UK and were so hard up they lived with relatives.</p><p>Millie said: “It was very hard. There were lots of tears along the way.”</p><p>She almost quit acting, with an agent telling her she was too mature the day before she auditioned for Stranger Things.</p><p>She said: “I had to cry in the audition. My emotions were so raw, I hit it out of the park.”</p><p>And with her breakout role as lab experiment Eleven, Millie soared to superstardom.</p><p>She somehow understands the human experience as if she has lived it for a thousand years.</p><span class=quote-credit>Aaron Paul</span><p>Even so, at times her accent has caused confusion, with her American twang leading to claims that she fakes her British accent.</p><p>On speaking with an English accent in the 2020 Netflix film Enola Holmes — which she produced with her sister Paige and starred in the title role — she said: “For the last five years I’ve been playing an American character in Stranger Things and I found it really challenging being British in this, even though I am a Brit.</p><p>“I had to learn how to speak again because I’m so used to speaking in an American accent.”</p><p>But now she is more than just an actress — she is slowly but steadily starting to build an empire.</p><p>While many youngsters her age are snoozing well into the afternoon, Millie has an exhausting work ethic.</p><p>With three Vogue magazine covers under her belt, she is firmly established as a Gen Z fashionista.</p><p>In 2019 she launched her make-up brand Florence by Mills to her 57.8million instagram followers.</p><p>She said: “Everything’s anti-ageing, everything is depuffing. We don’t know what that means.</p><p>“I need to know more.</p><p>I’ve been playing an American character in Stranger Things and I found it really challenging being British in this.</p><span class=quote-credit>Millie Bobby Brown</span><p>“And I know our generation needs to know more.”</p><p>Millie is now working on the sequel to Enola Holmes, as well as a film called Damsel, while also finding the time to serve as a Unicef Goodwill Am- bassador.</p><p>And she has also been accepted into Indiana’s Purdue University to study human services to “learn about the system and how to help young people”.</p><p>With so much under her belt so young, it’s no wonder Millie was featured in Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential list in 2018.</p><p>And in the magazine, Breaking Bad actor <a href=#>Aaron Paul</a> hinted that her wisdom beyond her years was her superpower.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He said: “Maybe that’s why she’s such an extraordinary actor.</p><p>“She somehow understands the human experience as if she has lived it for a thousand years.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huYGd%2Fd36TaKqtqpGjtKa%2BjK2foqaXqHqutculoJ5lkqSvo8WMm6mor55isq%2BzwKCcpp2eqXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-engagement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-engagement.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-engagement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-engagement.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-engagement.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-engagement.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jaimie-alexander-red-carpet-dress-thor-premiere-sheer-black-gown.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jaimie-alexander-red-carpet-dress-thor-premiere-sheer-black-gown.html>Jaimie Alexanders Red Carpet Dress Thor Gown Shows Empowered Sexuality Hollywood Li</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ken-jenkins.html>Fame | Ken Jenkins net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ken-jenkins.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
