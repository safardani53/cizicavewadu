They ultimately accused their director of body-shaming tactics.</p><p>The lawsuits were eventually dropped, according to the Houston Chronicle, and <a href=#>submitted to binding arbitration</a>. The cheerleaders' lawyers later confirmed the cases were resolved in private but details of the outcome were confidential.</p><p>Sadly it doesn't stop with the NFL. Former NBA cheerleader Lauren Herington - who danced for the Milwaukee Bucks from 2013 to 2014 - has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previously spoken out with her own allegations of body shaming</a>, telling Yahoo Lifestyle: "My coach would make me sit in [a broom closet] before games and think about if I was doing everything to be able to lose weight."</p><p>She claimed her coach would ask her to wear spandex before performing a "jiggle test" in front of the team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000558658341.jpg><p>“She’d come up and grab underneath my butt or the side of my belly,” Lauren told the news outlet. “She’d be like, ‘Lose 5 pounds by tomorrow, and you’ll be fine.’”</p><p>The Bucks later told Yahoo Lifestyle that they take all of the allegations “very seriously” but “have found no evidence to support these claims”.<br></p><h2>'Terrible pay'</h2><p>There have been a number of lawsuits filed in the States regarding NFL cheerleaders' pay in previous years, with one Oakland Raiders cheerleader suing the team over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claims she was paid less than $5 an hour</a>.</p><p>The claims were part of a major lawsuit against the Raiders - brought by cheerleaders named in the media as Lacy T. and Sarah G. - which<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> resulted in a $1.25 million settlement</a>, according to the LA Times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000558658261.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000558658426.jpg><p>It was reportedly agreed that cheerleaders on the team would receive $2,500 in back pay and penalties for the 2013-14 season, plus $6,000 in back pay and penalties for each of the three seasons before that.</p><p>Meanwhile, while NBA cheerleader Lauren Herington previously made body-shaming claims against her team the Milwaukee Bucks, she actually also brought a class-action lawsuit against the team in 2015 for unfair pay.</p><p>She claimed, after covering costs of required beauty treatments, her teammates were effectively paid as little as US$3-$4 (£2-3) an hour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000558658347.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More in news</h2></p><p>While the Bucks initially denied the claims, they eventually agreed to settle and paid around $250,000 (£190,500) in lost wages to around 40 dancers, according to multiple reports at the time.</p><p>Netflix' Cheer focuses more on the brutal practices America's cheerleaders have to face, however a writer for The Atlantic, Amanda Mull, previously stated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an opinion piece on the TV series&nbsp;</a>that it also highlights "one of the oldest, darkest stories in American sports - of athletes with no pay and little support breaking their bodies again and again, all for the greater glory of an authority figure they dare not question".</p><p>Now, with the world's eyes on cheerleading at its very finest this weekend for the 2020 Super Bowl, plus the huge success of Netflix' Cheer, the brutal reality of NFL and other American cheerleading has never been more in the spotlight.</p><p>It no doubt sparks hopes that there will be further, positive changes for America's hard-working cheerleaders in the future.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>First male cheerleaders make Super Bowl history as they perform before LA Rams vs New England Patriots</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZGp%2Bd3%2BOp5ytnpyexbR5wqGcnqpdp7K3scClqmackae4bsPOq6OdZZ%2Bbeq%2Byy2aaoZ2Vp7mmrcOipaBlp52ys7GMqaOaq6SesG6%2FzKKjnqtdnbalsYybqaijlaN6o7vNnqpmnpGperS0wKagp59dlrulecarpqmhnpx8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnetflixs-cheer-reveals-dark-world-of-nfl-cheerleading-where-plastic-smiles-hide-broken-bones-fat-shaming-and-groping.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnetflixs-cheer-reveals-dark-world-of-nfl-cheerleading-where-plastic-smiles-hide-broken-bones-fat-shaming-and-groping.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnetflixs-cheer-reveals-dark-world-of-nfl-cheerleading-where-plastic-smiles-hide-broken-bones-fat-shaming-and-groping.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnetflixs-cheer-reveals-dark-world-of-nfl-cheerleading-where-plastic-smiles-hide-broken-bones-fat-shaming-and-groping.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnetflixs-cheer-reveals-dark-world-of-nfl-cheerleading-where-plastic-smiles-hide-broken-bones-fat-shaming-and-groping.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnetflixs-cheer-reveals-dark-world-of-nfl-cheerleading-where-plastic-smiles-hide-broken-bones-fat-shaming-and-groping.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./strictly-nikita-kuzman-dating-australian-sex-podcast.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./strictly-nikita-kuzman-dating-australian-sex-podcast.html>Strictly's Nikita Kuzman 'dating Australian sex podcaster who talks about their romps on show'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./matt-cermanski-have-a-little-faith-in-me-the-voice-blind-auditio.html>Matt Cermanski -
