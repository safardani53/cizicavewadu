The siblings confirmed the death of their "incredible, fierce and loving mother" in a statement to PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As iconic as she was on screen, she was an even more amazing mother and grandmother," they said, remembering her "zest and passion for life, her children, grandchildren and her many animals, not to mention her eternal joy of creating, were unparalleled and leave us inspired to live life to the fullest just as she did."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On what would have been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alley's 72nd birthday</a>, Lillie celebrated her late mom on Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"happy birthday mama ❤️ wish you were here," she captioned four black-and-white photos of a young Alley.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Theo Wargo/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alley became a mom in 1992 when she adopted her son True (who goes by his middle name) with her then-husband, Parker Stevenson. Two years later, they became a family of four with the addition of their daughter, Lillie. Though Alley and Stevenson divorced in 1997, they continued to share joint custody of their children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My best quality is that I'm a good mother," Alley previously told PEOPLE in 2006.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mirek Towski/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2016, the actress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>became a first-time grandmother</a> after True welcomed a son of his own. "When your son has a son … bliss … yes this is my secret happy news as promised … Welcome Waylon Tripp Parker," she tweeted along with a photo of True holding his newborn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that year, Alley <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated her first Christmas with her grandson</a>, telling PEOPLE the occasion was "stupendous and exhilarating."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Kirstie Alley's two children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-william-true-31></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>William True, 31</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeffrey Ufberg/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alley and Stevenson first became parents in 1992. The Cheers actress later discussed her fertility struggles, sharing that she had suffered a miscarriage in 1990 when she was three months pregnant. In her 2005 book, she opened up about how she struggled physically and emotionally after her pregnancy loss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When the baby was gone, I just didn't really get over it. Neither did my body. I so throughly convinced my body that it was still pregnant after nine months that I had milk coming from my breasts. I was still fat, I was still grieving, and I had just been told it was very possible I would never be able to have children," she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alley and Stevenson decided to adopt, and the couple welcomed their son William True two years after their pregnancy loss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">True mainly grew up out of the spotlight, though Alley did share occasional anecdotes about her children over the years. "They are very protective of me," she told PEOPLE of True and his sister Lillie in 2006. The actress also cited her kids as one of her inspirations for getting healthy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My kids are always in the pool or the ocean or some lake beckoning me to come in," the Jenny Craig spokesman wrote of why she was working towards her goal of feeling more confident in a swimsuit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Alley famously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>appeared on Oprah</a> in a bikini in 2006 to celebrate her weight loss journey, she told the host she did so with the support of her children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I said to my kids, 'Can I do this? Will I embarrass you?' " she recalled. "They were laughing about it."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michael Tran/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When True was 17, he married his high school sweetheart after one year together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel good because they're really in love," Alley told <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ellen DeGeneres</a> ahead of her son's nuptials in 2010. "True's got a level head. He's a good guy. He's very monogamous and he's very sweet with her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress then reflected on her own past marriages. "I was married when I was just 19 years old and that didn't work," she told DeGeneres. "Then I was married when I was 30 years old and that's when everyone said you should get married and that didn't work. So I don't think I'm an expert on the subject."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She concluded, "I think if somebody's in love and wants to be married then let them be in love and get married."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2016, True welcomed his first child, Waylon Tripp Parker. Alley celebrated the new arrival on Twitter, sharing several photos of the newborn. "Just GOTTA send one more..proud Gammy," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>captioned</a> one snap.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few months later, Alley celebrated her first Christmas as a grandmother with then-six-month-old Waylon, telling PEOPLE the holiday was "amazing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My son and his girlfriend came to work for me for three months, so I had my grandson with me for three months and it was nothing short of stupendous and exhilarating," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I got up in the morning, as soon as that baby was up, I was holding that baby, traipsing around with him and showing him all the Christmas lights and singing to him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress also discussed the joy of watching her own son's fatherhood journey. "It's heartwarming to see your own child have a child," she said. "My son and his girlfriend are amazing parents. I couldn't have dreamt of anyone being better parents. I always knew my son would be because he loves babies, he's always loved little kids, they've always gotten along really well with him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "He's just an excellent dad, really hands-on.

She found love at a young age with her boyfriend Nick Trela, whom she reportedly began dating at age 16, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Lillie was 20, Trela was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident in L.A. in 2014. Alley's close friends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>John Travolta</a> and Kelly Preston were seen attending a memorial service for Trela alongside Alley and Lillie in photographs obtained by the Daily Mail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Lillie celebrated Mother's Day with a sweet tribute to Alley on Instagram. "Happpy Mother's Day ❤️," she captioned a throwback snap of the mother-duo daughter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That same year, Lillie announced her engagement to her boyfriend Chaffee Burkhart Graham on Instagram. "Yesterday the love of my life asked me to marry him. There is no one in the world I would rather spend every day with. You are my favorite and I cannot wait to call you my husband!" she wrote next to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photo</a> of the couple kissing while she showed off her new ring.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lillie welcomed her first child in May 2021, a son named Ripp Woodrow Graham. "You are perfect. Thank you for making me a mother 💙," she wrote on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> announcing his birth. One year later, she celebrated Ripp's first birthday with a sweet collage of images, including several snaps from his party.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She captioned one <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photo</a> of the little boy riding a pony: "My best friend. thank you for making me a mama. i love you more and more every day."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmmqScYq6ju9StZKShoqjBqrGMmqOlnaliuKqw0mg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-about-kirstie-alley-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-about-kirstie-alley-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-about-kirstie-alley-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-about-kirstie-alley-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-about-kirstie-alley-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-about-kirstie-alley-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maleficent-premiere-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maleficent-premiere-pics.html>Maleficent Premiere Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kardashian-christmas-card-how-much-did-it-cost.html>How Much Did it Cost?!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kardashian-christmas-card-how-much-did-it-cost.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
