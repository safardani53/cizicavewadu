We've all heard the rumours.</p><p>"I always had the understanding that he was, for lack of a better word, 'dodgy', and I should avoid him."</p><h2>'HUGE FAN'</h2><p>Hughes said she was a "huge fan" of Brand when she signed with his agent at the height of his career.</p><p>She added: "I was so excited to meet him. But my first day at the agency I was told unprovoked that I shouldn't sleep with him under any circumstances.</p><p>"He likes to pursue women, have sex with them. But as soon as he has sex with them they'd make him feel sick and he didn't want to be around them anymore."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Showbiz</h2></p><p>She claimed Brand would then "have them fired, or dropped from the agency".</p><p>"It happened several times in the past. I was 22 at the time, did what I was told and completely avoided him."</p><p>Hughes added that she was "not shocked by the documentary at all" and said "I believe everything those brave women said".</p><p>Her comments were met with attacks from "trolls" who claimed she was a "shameless parasite" and "lying piece of s**t".</p><p>She added: "Ugh, now I'm getting abuse from weirdo rape apologists. My mentions are a mess. I've only been back in the UK for five days and you lot are already stressing me out. This is why I live in Los Angeles.</p><p>"Support women and leave me alone please, thank you."</p><p>One comment underneath her posts read: "I don't know many guys who wouldn't accept sex on a plate. They think about it every 6 seconds and have porn on speed dial. Please your making out he pursued you."</p><p>Another added: "You promoting a book or something? Making up bs about someone is an effective way to NOT sell a book. Might be time for your cancelling."</p><p>A spokesman for Rishi Sunak today called the allegations "very serious and concerning".</p><p>They added: "People should feel able to raise concerns when they have them and know they will be taken seriously. There should never be any space for harassment regardless of where it is found.</p><p>"I think the BBC and Channel 4 have said they will investigate and that's the right step. I won't pre-judge that but they should present results of the findings transparently."</p><p>It comes as Brand's former agent John Noel told the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a>: "I never had any complaints about him."</p><p>One woman claimed <a href=#>Brand raped her</a> against a wall at his home in <a href=#>Los Angeles</a>.</p><p>A second said a 31-year-old Brand forced her to perform oral sex until she choked when she was just 16.</p><p>She claimed she had to punch him in the stomach to make him stop.</p><p>The girl, given the pseudonym Alice, also claimed he referred to her as "the child" during a three-month-long abusive relationship.</p><p>She has since blasted Brand's response to the allegations as "insulting".</p><p>Alice added: "It is laughable that he would even imply that it's a mainstream media conspiracy. He's not outside of mainstream media."</p><p>She says Brand's YouTube channel allows him to talk about conspiracy theories and frame the allegations in those terms.</p><p>"I think he was building himself an audience for years that would then have great distrust of any publication that came forward with allegations. He knew it was coming for a long time."</p><p>She says that she was not surprised that Brand denied all the allegations and said they were all consensual.</p><p>"What he didn't deny was that he had a relationship with a 16 year old," she added.</p><p>It comes as...</p><p>A third woman, who said she worked with brand, claimed he sexually assaulted her and then threatened to take legal action if she spoke out.</p><p>While <a href=#>Jordan Martin</a>, who previously wrote a book on the alleged abuse she endured in February 2007, said he was emotionally and sexually abusive.</p><p>During one incident he made her brush her teeth so hard her gums bled, she claimed.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">The claims against Russell Brand</h3></p><p>Woman 1: Claims Brand raped her in his Los Angeles Home</p><p>Woman 2: Claims Brand forced her to perform oral sex when she was just 16.</p><p>Woman 3: Claims Brand sexually assault her in LA and threatened legal action if she spoke out.</p><p>Woman 4: Claims he subjected her to emotional abuse, sexual abuse and made her brush her teeth so hard her gums bled.</p><p>Meanwhile, cops have been urged to launch a probe into the allegations against Brand.</p><p>Caroline Nokes, Conservative chairwoman of the Commons women and equalities committee, said celebrity can "act as a shield" for abusive behaviour.</p><p>She told&nbsp;Today&nbsp;on BBC Radio 4: “I would very much hope that complaints will be made both to the Metropolitan Police and indeed in the States, because this merits and needs a criminal investigation, because for too long we have seen men — and the perpetrators of these sorts of crimes are almost invariably men — not being held to account for their behaviours and their actions.”</p><p>Brand's father Ron, 80, has blasted the allegations as he defended his son.</p><p>He posted on Facebook: "Is this seriously the most important thing happening in the world?"</p><p>Ahead of The Times publishing its expose,&nbsp;<a href=#>Brand</a>&nbsp;denied all the allegations against him, slamming them as "aggressive attacks".</p><p>He performed a stand-up show in <a href=#>Wembley</a> just hours after the allegations emerged.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>And he posted a video to YouTube to "absolutely refute" the claims, adding that his relationships during a "promiscuous" time in his life were "always consensual".</p><p>Sun Online has contacted London Hughes for comment.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Russell Brand's video transcript in full</h3></p><p>Hello there, you awakening wonders.</p><p>Now this isn't the usual type of video we make on this channel where we critique, attack and undermine the news in all its corruption because in this story I am the news.</p><p>I have received two extremely disturbing letters - well a letter and an email.</p><p>One from a mainstream media TV company, one from a newspaper, listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks as well as some pretty stupid stuff - like my community festival should be stopped, that I shouldn't be able to attack mainstream media narratives on this channel.</p><p>But amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque, attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute. These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream - when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies, and as I have written about extensively in my books I was very very promiscuous</p><p>Now during that time of promiscuity, the relationships I had were absolutely always consensual. I was always transparent about that then, almost too transparent. And I'm being transparent about it now as well.&nbsp;</p><p>And to see that transparency metastasized into something criminal that I absolutely deny makes me question is there another agenda at play?</p><p>Particularly when we have seen coordinated media attacks before - like with Joe Rogan when he dared to take a medicine that the mainstream media didn't approve of and we saw a spate of headlines from media outlets across the world using the same language.</p><p>I’m aware that you guys have been saying in the comments for a while ‘Watch out Russell, they are coming for you, you are getting too close to the truth, Russell Brand did not kill himself’.</p><p>I know that a year ago there was a spate of articles ‘Russell Brand is a conspiracy theorist, Russell Brand’s right wing’.</p><p>I’m aware of news media making phone calls, sending letters to people I know for ages and ages.</p><p>It’s been clear to me or at least it feels to me like there's a serious and concerted agenda to control these kind of spaces and these kind of voices and I mean my voice along with your voice.</p><p>I don't mind them using my books and my stand up to talk about my promiscuous consensual conduct in the past. What I seriously refute are these very very serious criminal allegations.&nbsp;</p><p>Also it’s worth mentioning that there are witnesses whose evidence directly contradicts the narratives that these two mainstream media outlets are trying to construct apparently in what seems to me to be a coordinated attack</p><p>Now I don't want to get into this any further because of the serious nature of the allegations, but I feel like I'm being attacked and plainly they are working very closely together</p><p>We are obviously going to look into this matter because it’s very, very serious. In the meantime I want you to stay close, stay awake but more important than any of that if you can, please, stay free.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/russell-brand-denies-accusations-rape-845495566-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxYWaCeH2YaKOoppSku2601KCfnqtdmLmitcysZKyglWLEor%2BMsJirppWZerPB0qycpaRdl7%2BiusNo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flondon-hughes-claims-she-was-warned-russell-brand.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flondon-hughes-claims-she-was-warned-russell-brand.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flondon-hughes-claims-she-was-warned-russell-brand.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flondon-hughes-claims-she-was-warned-russell-brand.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flondon-hughes-claims-she-was-warned-russell-brand.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flondon-hughes-claims-she-was-warned-russell-brand.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pregnant-elin-nordegrens-bf-jordan-cameron-5-things-to-know.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pregnant-elin-nordegrens-bf-jordan-cameron-5-things-to-know.html>Pregnant Elin Nordegrens BF Jordan Cameron: 5 Things to Know</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./harry-styles-drugs-smoke.html>Harry Styles Candidly Speaks About Experimenting With Drugs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./harry-styles-drugs-smoke.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
