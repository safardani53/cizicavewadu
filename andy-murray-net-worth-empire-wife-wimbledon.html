million</a>, owns a stunning supercar collection and various businesses, including the most luxurious hotel in Scotland.</p><p>We look at how Murray has built up his huge bank balance over the years…</p><h2>£50m career prize money</h2><p>Murray has earned over £50million in career prize money over the years, having won Wimbledon twice, in 2013 and 2016, and the US Open in 2012.</p><p>Only <a href=#>Novak Djokovic</a>, <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a> and <a href=#>Roger Federer</a> have earned more in prize money.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE IN SPORT">READ MORE IN SPORT</h2><p>In 2016, his most fruitful year, he made an astonishing £12.8 million thanks to winning nine titles.</p><p>From just his Wimbledon men’s singles title alone, he earned a cool £2 million.</p><h2>Multi-million-pound sponsorship deals</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2018-06-andy-murray-goes-790230947.jpg><p>As a tennis champ, big brands have offered Murray millions to sponsor him.</p><p>Since 2019, he’s been sponsored by clothing brand <a href=#>Castore</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Sport</h2></p><p>In November of that year, he launched his clothing line, AMC, with the brand, with all the clothes made from recycled and regenerated materials.</p><p>Andy now always plays in AMC, and will be seen sporting the brand throughout Wimbledon.</p><p>Prior to Castore, Murray was sponsored by Under Armour, signing a four-year sponsorship deal with the sportswear brand in 2015 for a whopping £15 million.</p><p>Prior to that, he was sponsored by Adidas.</p><p>He’s worked with many other brands, including sports equipment company Head,&nbsp;watchmaker Rado and insurance company Standard Life.</p><p>And in 2016, he signed a sponsorship agreement with <a href=#>Jaguar</a>, for £1.5million.</p><h2>£22m business and investments</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/inside-andy-murrays-5m-surrey-829905296.jpg><p>In 2013, after becoming the first British player to win Wimbledon in 77 years, Murray started up his sports marketing agency, 77 Management.</p><p>The business, created alongside his two business advisors, Matt Gentry and Gawain Davies, was <a href=#>valued at £22.6 million in 2021</a>.</p><p>The company controls Murray’s image rights, and manages many other sports stars.</p><p>In 2018, Murray also invested in Deuce, an app that helps tennis players find courts and coaching sessions across the UK</p><h2>Luxury hotel business</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/300-guests-expected-attend-reception-163368858.jpg><p>Murray bought the luxury<a href=#> Cromlix House Hotel</a> in Perthshire, Scotland, near his home town of Dunblane, for £1.8million in 2013.</p><p>The hotel is surrounded by 50 acres of woodland, and boasts its own chapel and trout loch.</p><p>Murray got married to his wife Kim at the hotel, as did as his elder brother Jamie.&nbsp;</p><p>He spent £6million renovating the hotel and it’s since become a five-star complex with an Albert Roux restaurant.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also been named the most luxurious hotel in Scotland at the Scottish Hotel Awards.</p><p>Cromlix was run by a management firm until December 2022, when Murray and his wife Kim announced they would be taking over the running of it.</p><p>And earlier this year, Murray <a href=#>applied to trademark the name</a> of his luxury hotel to launch a range of merchandise, including air fragrance diffusers, soap, perfumes, massage gels and hair conditioners.</p><p>Murray is also seeking ownership over any furniture, candles, bath robes, dressing gowns and slippers bearing the name.</p><h2>Supercar collection</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

He now has an<a href=#> impressive collection of supercars</a>, but was <a href=#>clinging on to his first ever car</a> - his beloved <a href=#>Vokswagen Polo</a> - for 14 years.</p><p>Despite his wife Kim begging him to scrap it, he was using the car he got at the age of 22 as a runaround to avoid being recognised in, admitting he’s still “strongly attached to it”.</p><p>He finally traded it in for a bright red <a href=#>Ferrari </a>430 in 2010, estimated to have set him back £117,000.</p><p>But. amusingly, he ditched it just five months later, saying he felt like “a bit of a prat” behind the wheel of the stand-out car.</p><p>He said: "I keeled in to peer pressure but I didn’t enjoy driving it at all. It was a mistake."</p><p>The Scottish star swapped the extravagant supercar for an <a href=#>Aston Martin</a> DB9 - just like <a href=#>James Bond</a> - for £200,000 instead.</p><p>Murray confessed he liked the stunning motor "a lot more", especially because of its inconspicuous colour.</p><p>He explained: "With the Aston, yes, it’s a beautiful car, but it was a bit more understated — and it wasn’t red."</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=#>Wimbledon 2023 LIVE: Point-by-point action, results and news</a> from the All England Club</strong></p><p class=has-text-align-center><a href=#><strong>Wimbledon betting special: Tips, predictions and odds</strong></a></p><p>Murray later bagged a £125,000 <a href=#>BMW</a> i8 after winning the Munich Open - but regifted it to his father.</p><p>In 2016, <a href=#>his sponsorship deal with Jaguar</a> ensured the tennis ace was always traveling in style.</p><p>He rolled around in the enviable <a href=#>Jaguar</a> XKR before owning the £66,000 Jaguar I-Pace, arguably a standout in his collection.</p><p>He was one of the first owners of the British carmaker's all-electric performance SUVs.</p><p>The tennis legend has also been spotted ferrying his family around in a <a href=#>Porsche</a> Cayenne SUV.</p><p>But despite his enviable car collection, the VW Polo is the vehicle that remains closest to his heart.</p><p>He reportedly allows his pals to whizz around in the budget motor to ensure it isn't left to rot.</p><h2>£5m mansion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/andy-murray-selling-miami-penthouse-342850520-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/andy-murrays-new-home-surrey-505660.jpg><p>Murray has had some beautiful homes over the years too.</p><p>He bought a penthouse apartment in <a href=#>Miami </a>in 2008, selling it eight years later for £2.4million, to spend more time with his family in the UK.</p><p>And in 2016, he moved from his riverside <a href=#>London</a> apartment to a £5.5million country mansion in Oxshott, <a href=#>Surrey</a>.</p><p>The 28-acre mansion, where he lived with Kim and their four children -
